0,Rustic Onion Tart,"Rustic onion tart with caramelized red onions, Gruyere cheese, and a butter crust.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/rustic_onion_tart/,,"Prepare the dough:
If you are making a crust from scratch, prepare the dough and let it chill in the refrigerator while you are cooking the onions.
To prepare the dough, whisk the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Cut the butter into the flour with your hands or with a pastry cutter, until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
Add the sour cream and use a fork to incorporate it into the dough. Gather the dough into a ball and shape it into a disk. Wrap it with plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour.
Prepare the onions:
Peel and slice the onlions lengthwise from stem to root. (See How to Slice an Onion)
Caramelize the onions:
Heat olive oil and butter in a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan on medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them.
Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent.
Elise Bauer

Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned.
Add balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.
Roll out the dough:
Preheat the oven to 450°F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand for 5 minutes before rolling it out.
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 13-inch diameter. Transfer the crust dough to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Layer the cheese and onions onto the dough:
Place all but a couple tablespoons of the cheese in the center of the dough. Spread to within 1 1/2 inches from the edges. Add the caramelized onions, layering them on top of the cheese. Sprinkle with thyme.

1,Pork Stir Fry With Green Onion,"This Pork Stir Fry is such an easy weeknight meal. Made with just lean pork, some green onions, and garlic, and ready in 25 minutes start to finish.

Pork chops tend to come in thicknesses either around 1/2 inch thick or an inch thick. If you are working with a thick boneless pork chop, start by slicing it into two thin layers, horizontally. If starting with pork loin, cut slices 1/2 inch thick.
Put the slices under some plastic wrap or wax paper and pound them thin with a rubber mallet, meat mallet or even an empty wine bottle. This will help tenderize the meat. The slices should be about 1/4 inch thick.
Cut the pork across the grain into thin strips, about 1 1/2 inches long.
Marinate the pork:
Put the soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch into a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the pork strips to the bowl with the marinade and toss to coat completely. Set aside for at least 10 minutes.
Stir fry pork on high heat:
Heat the peanut oil in a wok or large sauté pan on high heat. When the oil is hot (shimmering but not smoking) add the garlic slices and stir-fry until they begin to turn brown at the edges, about 30 seconds.
Add the pork strips and stir-fry until the pork changes color, about 90 seconds, stirring constantly.

Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Roast the vegetables until their edges are nicely caramelized, turning the radicchio and onion wedges over about halfway through the roasting.
The radicchio, onion, and squash will roast at different speeds. So periodically you'll have to remove the finished vegetables and let the others remain in the oven to finish roasting. As a guideline, roast the radicchio for about 25 minutes, turning halfway.
Roast the onions about 35 minutes, again, turning halfway. Roast the squash pieces for 45 minutes, but do not turn.
In all cases do not remove from the oven until you see browning on the edges.
Toast the pine nuts:
While the vegetables are roasting, toast the pine nuts. Heat a small pan on medium high heat. Add the pine nuts in a single layer. Cook until lightly toasted. Remove from heat to a bowl to keep the nuts from burning.
Chop roasted radicchio and onions:
Once all the vegetables are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the radicchio and onion into manageable pieces.
Toss with pine nuts, parsley, balsamic, black pepper:
Place the radicchio, onion, and butternut squash in a large serving bowl. Add the pine nuts and parsley. Add black pepper to taste. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar. Stir gently to combine, taking care not to squish the soft roasted squash.
To serve, sprinkle with some grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese.

6,How to Chop an Onion,"Here’s the best way to chop an onion safely and easily, plus a video with step-by-step instructions. No tears required!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_chop_an_onion/,"1 onion,","Slice 1/2 inch from stem end, barely slice root end:
Onions have two ends—a stem end, and a root end. Place the onion on a cutting board with the stem end pointing to the side.
Hold the onion firmly with one hand, and with the other hand, cut about 1/2-inch from the top of the stem end of the onion with a sharp chef's knife.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Then, turn the onion around and make a shallow cut (maybe 1/8-inch) off the root end, cutting off the stringy roots, but leaving the hard root core intact.
Cut onion in half, top to bottom:
Place the onion large-cut side down on the board (with the shallow root cut side on top). With the onion stabilized on the board, position the chef's knife directly over the root end of the onion and cut straight down to cut the onion in half.
Elise Bauer
Place the onion halves cut side down on the board to minimize exposure to the eye-hurting fumes coming from the cut sides of the onion.
Peel back the onion skin:
Peel back the onion skin of one of the onion halves. There is no need to pull it all the way off if it's still attached to the root end.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Make lengthwise cuts, angled toward center:
Place the onion half large-cut-side down on the cutting board. Make lengthwise cuts into the onion, from root end to stem end, with the knife tip almost all the way to the root end (but not cutting through the root end).
Cut at an angle as you go around the onion, with the blade aimed toward the center of the onion.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
The number of cuts depends on how big a chop or slice size you want, fewer cuts for thick slices or roughly chopped, more cuts for thin slices or finely chopped.
Make cross-wise cuts:
Once you are finished making angled lengthwise cuts, make cross-wise cuts. Hold the onion firmly with your fingers curled so that your knuckles press against the side of the knife as you cut the onion (This protects your fingertips from getting cut.).
As you make cuts from the end of the onion, scoot your hand back, using your knuckles as a guide for the knife.

7,Extra-Crunchy Onion Rings,"We’ve got the best crunchy, homemade onion rings made simple. Our batter uses cornmeal and buttermilk for an added tangy crunch.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/onion_rings/,"2 cups buttermilk, or 1 cup plain yogurt mixed with 1 cup milk,2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided,2 large yellow onions, peeled, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick ringed slices, rings separated (See How to Slice an Onion),1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided,1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour,1/3 cup cornmeal,3 cups frying oil, such as peanut oil, canola oil, or rice bran oil,","Coat the onion rings in seasoned buttermilk:
In a large bowl, stir together the buttermilk (or yogurt and milk) with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the black pepper.
Stir the onions into the buttermilk mixture and make sure every ring is completely coated in buttermilk. Let sit for 15 to 30 minutes.
Elise Bauer
Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl:
In a separate bowl (large enough to dredge the onion rings), whisk together the flour and cornmeal, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and set aside.
Heat the oil in thick-bottomed pot:
Add 2 to 3 cups of oil to a large (5- to 6-quart), thick-bottomed pot. (Make sure that the pot is absolutely dry on the inside before adding the oil or any residual water will splatter as the oil heats.) Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot by 3/4 to 1 inch.
Heat the oil to 375°F. Use a good candy thermometer or instant thermometer (such as a Thermapen) to measure the heat of the oil. You may need to tilt the pan in order to cover the thermometer's sensor completely and get an accurate reading.
Be very careful whenever handling hot oil. No running kids in the kitchen. No distractions. Do not answer the phone if it rings. Pay attention. Have the pan's lid close by.
Test the oil by dropping a small pinch of flour into the hot oil. If the flour sizzles the oil is ready. If it burns, remove the pot from the heat and let the oil cool down a little.
Elise Bauer
Dredge the buttermilk coated onion rings in the flour mixture (twice):
Remove onion rings one at a time out of the buttermilk mixture and dredge them in the flour mixture to coat.
Elise Bauer
If the coating seems a bit thin (it might) or if you want extra crunchy onion rings, dip the onion rings again in the buttermilk mixture and dredge them again in the flour. This double coating will make the onion rings extra crunchy.
Fry in the oil:
Use tongs to place the rings one by one into the hot oil. Fry for a minute on each side, until golden brown.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
When you add the onion rings to the pot, the oil temperature will naturally lower. Adjust the heat so that the temperature of the oil in the pan stays between 350°F and 390°F.
Keep warm in the oven:
Place the fried onion rings on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Keep the fried onion rings warm in a 200°F oven while you fry the rest of the rings.
Add more oil if needed between batches. Let the oil heat back up to 375°F before starting a new batch.
Serve immediately.
Note: It's best not to pour the leftover oil down the drain. Better to pour into an empty jar and discard with your trash.;","1771

Select the high sauté setting on your pressure cooker. If it’s an Instant Pot or similar model, the timer should default to a cooking time of 30 minutes. You will use every minute of this to sauté the onions.
Add the fat and caramelize the onions:
Add the butter or oil to the pressure cooker. Once the butter has melted or the oil shimmers, about 2 minutes, add the onions, sugar, and salt and stir with a wooden spoon, separating the onion layers and coating the slices with the fat.
Cover the pot with a tempered glass lid or other 9-inch pot lid and let the onions cook, without stirring, for 10 minutes.
Coco Morante

Coco Morante
Uncover the pot and continue cooking the onions:
Uncover the pot. At this point the onions should be softened, but not brown, and there should be some liquid at the bottom of the pot.
While wearing an oven mitt, hold the rim of the inner pot in place, and stir the onions vigorously. Be careful not to splash hot liquid on yourself.
Continue to stir the onions vigorously every 2 minutes, making sure to nudge loose any fond or brown bits from the bottom of the pot as it develops with your spoon. Do this until the sauté cooking program has ended after 30 minutes and the pot turns off automatically.
At this point, the onions should be caramelized and golden brown.
Coco Morante
Deglaze the pot and cook the soup under pressure:
While the pot is off but still hot and the onions are sizzling, add the sherry. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly scrape any remaining fond from the pot bottom.
Stir in the broth, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaf, and pepper. Secure the pressure cooker lid in its sealing position, then select the manual setting, and set the time for 5 minutes at high pressure.
(The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Release the pressure and prepare to serve:
When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes, then move the pressure release valve to ""venting"" to release any remaining steam.
At this point, the soup will stay hot on the “keep warm” setting for up to 10 hours, until you are ready to serve it.
When you are ready to serve the soup, discard the bay leaf. Taste the soup for seasoning, adding salt and/or pepper if needed.
Make the toasts and finish the soup:
Preheat the broiler on your oven and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place broiler-safe serving bowls on the baking sheet, then ladle the soup into the bowls, filling them to about 1/2-inch from the top.
Spread the baguette slices very sparingly with Dijon mustard (1/4 teaspoon per slice), then place the baguette slices on top of the bowls of soup.
Heap a pile of the Gruyere cheese onto each baguette slice. Grind one or two grinds of black pepper on top of each slice. Broil for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown.

Heat the olive oil and add the onion:
Use a wide, thick-bottomed sauté pan for maximum pan contact with the onions. Coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil, or a mixture of olive oil and butter, if using (about 1 teaspoon per onion).

Heat the pan on medium high heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the onion slices and stir to coat the onions with the oil. Spread the onions out evenly over the pan and let cook, stirring occasionally.
Depending on how strong your stovetop burner is you may need to reduce the heat to medium or medium low to prevent the onions from burning or drying out.
After 10 minutes, sprinkle some salt over the onions, and if you want, you can add some sugar to help with the caramelization process. (I add only about a teaspoon of sugar for 5 onions, you can add more.) One trick to keeping the onions from drying out as they cook is to add a little water to the pan.
Cambrea Bakes
Cambrea Bakes
Stir the onions every few minutes:
Let the onions cook for 30 minutes to 1 hour more, stirring every few minutes. As soon as the onions start sticking to the pan, let them stick a little and brown, but then stir them before they burn.
The trick is to leave them alone enough to brown (if you stir them too often, they won't brown), but not so long so that they burn. After the first 20 to 30 minutes you may want to lower the stove temperature a little, and add a little more oil, if you find the onions are verging on burning.
A metal spatula will help you scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan as the caramelization proceeds. As the onions cook down, you may find you need to scrape the pan every minute, instead of every few minutes.
Continue to cook and scrape, cook and scrape, until the onions are a rich, browned color. At the end of the cooking process you might want to add a little balsamic vinegar or wine to help deglaze the pan and bring some additional flavor to the onions.

If you are making your own crust (instead of using an already prepared frozen crust), roll out your dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9 x 1 1/2-inch round tart pan (or 9-inch pie dish), pressing dough into corners, extending the edges extra high to allow for shrinkage. Transfer to freezer to chill for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Line pastry with aluminum foil, pressing into the corners and edges, allowing extra foil on the sides (they'll be your handles when you remove the foil).
Fill at least 2/3 of the crust with baking weights—dried beans, rice, copper pennies, or ceramic or metal pie weights.
Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer
Bake with the weights:
Bake first for 15 minutes, remove from the oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove aluminum foil and weights.
Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer
Remove the weights and bake again:
Poke the bottom of pie pan with the tines of a fork and return to oven, and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden. (Fork holes allow any air to escape.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool while making the filling.

Caramelize the onions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan on medium heat. Add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them. Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned.
Add 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.

Trim the root end, keeping it intact:
Trim the roots but keep the root end intact. The root end will help hold the onion together as you make the other cuts.
Elise Bauer

Peel back the onion skin:
Peel back the onion skin and place the onion halves cut side down on the board. If you want, to help keep your cutting area tidy, peel off or cut off the onion skin from the root end.
Elise Bauer

Slice the onion, making angled cuts:
Cutting along the natural lines of the onion, make angled cuts into the onion, aimed at the center of the onion. Cut almost all the way, but not all the way, to the root.
It will be easier to handle the onion while cutting if the root end stays intact. Space your cuts depending on how thick you want your onion slices to be. More cuts for thinner slices, fewer cuts for thicker slices.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Make a ""V"" cut:
Cut a ""V"" in the root end to cut away the tough root end that is holding the onion slices together. Then break apart the onion to get the slices.
Elise Bauer

Method for Slicing an Onion Crosswise
Halve the onion root to tip:
Cut off the stem end by half an inch. Cut the root end by 1/8 of an inch, leaving the root core in place.
Place the onion stem cut side down on the cutting board, cut it in half through the root, and peel back the skins as in steps above for slicing an onion root to stem.
Place the onion cut side down:
Place the onion halves cut side down onto the cutting board. Do not remove the skin you peeled back, which will act as a handle as you slice closer to the end of the onion. Place the onion halves cut side down on the cutting board.
Guide the knife with your fingers:
Hold the onion firmly with one hand, with the fingers curled inward. With a sharp chef's knife in the other hand, place the side of the blade against the knuckles of your index and middle fingers.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Slice the onion halves:
Use this as a guide as you make slices through the onion. The curled fingers will protect your fingertips from the knife while cutting the onion.
When you get close to the root end, you can hold on to the peeled back skins as you make the final cuts in the onion.
Here's a tip for serving slice onions raw in a salad or sandwich: soak them in a little water with lemon juice or vinegar to remove the harsh bite of the onion!
Method for Slicing an Onion into Onion Rings
Cut the stem:
Cut off the stem end of the onion and peel back its outer peel.
Elise Bauer
Cut a sliver of onion:
With the peeled onion on its side, slice off a thin sliver from the side. Then place the onion on the cutting board with this thin sliver cut side down.
This will stabilize the onion's position so as you slice the onion rings, the onion will not roll.

Heat the olive oil and add the onion:
Use a wide, thick-bottomed sauté pan for maximum pan contact with the onions. Coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil, or a mixture of olive oil and butter, if using (about 1 teaspoon per onion).

Heat the pan on medium high heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the onion slices and stir to coat the onions with the oil. Spread the onions out evenly over the pan and let cook, stirring occasionally.
Depending on how strong your stovetop burner is you may need to reduce the heat to medium or medium low to prevent the onions from burning or drying out.
After 10 minutes, sprinkle some salt over the onions, and if you want, you can add some sugar to help with the caramelization process. (I add only about a teaspoon of sugar for 5 onions, you can add more.) One trick to keeping the onions from drying out as they cook is to add a little water to the pan.
Cambrea Bakes
Cambrea Bakes
Stir the onions every few minutes:
Let the onions cook for 30 minutes to 1 hour more, stirring every few minutes. As soon as the onions start sticking to the pan, let them stick a little and brown, but then stir them before they burn.
The trick is to leave them alone enough to brown (if you stir them too often, they won't brown), but not so long so that they burn. After the first 20 to 30 minutes you may want to lower the stove temperature a little, and add a little more oil, if you find the onions are verging on burning.
A metal spatula will help you scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan as the caramelization proceeds. As the onions cook down, you may find you need to scrape the pan every minute, instead of every few minutes.
Continue to cook and scrape, cook and scrape, until the onions are a rich, browned color. At the end of the cooking process you might want to add a little balsamic vinegar or wine to help deglaze the pan and bring some additional flavor to the onions.
Store refrigerated for several days in an air-tight container.

31,How to Chop an Onion,"Here’s the best way to chop an onion safely and easily, plus a video with step-by-step instructions. No tears required!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_chop_an_onion/,"1 onion,","Slice 1/2 inch from stem end, barely slice root end:
Onions have two ends—a stem end, and a root end. Place the onion on a cutting board with the stem end pointing to the side.
Hold the onion firmly with one hand, and with the other hand, cut about 1/2-inch from the top of the stem end of the onion with a sharp chef's knife.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Then, turn the onion around and make a shallow cut (maybe 1/8-inch) off the root end, cutting off the stringy roots, but leaving the hard root core intact.
Cut onion in half, top to bottom:
Place the onion large-cut side down on the board (with the shallow root cut side on top). With the onion stabilized on the board, position the chef's knife directly over the root end of the onion and cut straight down to cut the onion in half.
Elise Bauer
Place the onion halves cut side down on the board to minimize exposure to the eye-hurting fumes coming from the cut sides of the onion.
Peel back the onion skin:
Peel back the onion skin of one of the onion halves. There is no need to pull it all the way off if it's still attached to the root end.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Make lengthwise cuts, angled toward center:
Place the onion half large-cut-side down on the cutting board. Make lengthwise cuts into the onion, from root end to stem end, with the knife tip almost all the way to the root end (but not cutting through the root end).
Cut at an angle as you go around the onion, with the blade aimed toward the center of the onion.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
The number of cuts depends on how big a chop or slice size you want, fewer cuts for thick slices or roughly chopped, more cuts for thin slices or finely chopped.
Make cross-wise cuts:
Once you are finished making angled lengthwise cuts, make cross-wise cuts. Hold the onion firmly with your fingers curled so that your knuckles press against the side of the knife as you cut the onion (This protects your fingertips from getting cut.).
As you make cuts from the end of the onion, scoot your hand back, using your knuckles as a guide for the knife.

Select the high sauté setting on your pressure cooker. If it’s an Instant Pot or similar model, the timer should default to a cooking time of 30 minutes. You will use every minute of this to sauté the onions.
Add the fat and caramelize the onions:
Add the butter or oil to the pressure cooker. Once the butter has melted or the oil shimmers, about 2 minutes, add the onions, sugar, and salt and stir with a wooden spoon, separating the onion layers and coating the slices with the fat.
Cover the pot with a tempered glass lid or other 9-inch pot lid and let the onions cook, without stirring, for 10 minutes.
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Uncover the pot and continue cooking the onions:
Uncover the pot. At this point the onions should be softened, but not brown, and there should be some liquid at the bottom of the pot.
While wearing an oven mitt, hold the rim of the inner pot in place, and stir the onions vigorously. Be careful not to splash hot liquid on yourself.
Continue to stir the onions vigorously every 2 minutes, making sure to nudge loose any fond or brown bits from the bottom of the pot as it develops with your spoon. Do this until the sauté cooking program has ended after 30 minutes and the pot turns off automatically.
At this point, the onions should be caramelized and golden brown.
Coco Morante
Deglaze the pot and cook the soup under pressure:
While the pot is off but still hot and the onions are sizzling, add the sherry. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly scrape any remaining fond from the pot bottom.
Stir in the broth, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaf, and pepper. Secure the pressure cooker lid in its sealing position, then select the manual setting, and set the time for 5 minutes at high pressure.
(The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Release the pressure and prepare to serve:
When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes, then move the pressure release valve to ""venting"" to release any remaining steam.
At this point, the soup will stay hot on the “keep warm” setting for up to 10 hours, until you are ready to serve it.
When you are ready to serve the soup, discard the bay leaf. Taste the soup for seasoning, adding salt and/or pepper if needed.
Make the toasts and finish the soup:
Preheat the broiler on your oven and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place broiler-safe serving bowls on the baking sheet, then ladle the soup into the bowls, filling them to about 1/2-inch from the top.
Spread the baguette slices very sparingly with Dijon mustard (1/4 teaspoon per slice), then place the baguette slices on top of the bowls of soup.
Heap a pile of the Gruyere cheese onto each baguette slice. Grind one or two grinds of black pepper on top of each slice. Broil for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown.

Our batter uses cornmeal and buttermilk for an added tangy crunch.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/onion_rings/,"2 cups buttermilk, or 1 cup plain yogurt mixed with 1 cup milk,2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided,2 large yellow onions, peeled, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick ringed slices, rings separated (See How to Slice an Onion),1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided,1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour,1/3 cup cornmeal,3 cups frying oil, such as peanut oil, canola oil, or rice bran oil,","Coat the onion rings in seasoned buttermilk:
In a large bowl, stir together the buttermilk (or yogurt and milk) with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the black pepper.
Stir the onions into the buttermilk mixture and make sure every ring is completely coated in buttermilk. Let sit for 15 to 30 minutes.
Elise Bauer
Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl:
In a separate bowl (large enough to dredge the onion rings), whisk together the flour and cornmeal, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and set aside.
Heat the oil in thick-bottomed pot:
Add 2 to 3 cups of oil to a large (5- to 6-quart), thick-bottomed pot. (Make sure that the pot is absolutely dry on the inside before adding the oil or any residual water will splatter as the oil heats.) Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot by 3/4 to 1 inch.
Heat the oil to 375°F. Use a good candy thermometer or instant thermometer (such as a Thermapen) to measure the heat of the oil. You may need to tilt the pan in order to cover the thermometer's sensor completely and get an accurate reading.
Be very careful whenever handling hot oil. No running kids in the kitchen. No distractions. Do not answer the phone if it rings. Pay attention. Have the pan's lid close by.
Test the oil by dropping a small pinch of flour into the hot oil. If the flour sizzles the oil is ready. If it burns, remove the pot from the heat and let the oil cool down a little.
Elise Bauer
Dredge the buttermilk coated onion rings in the flour mixture (twice):
Remove onion rings one at a time out of the buttermilk mixture and dredge them in the flour mixture to coat.
Elise Bauer
If the coating seems a bit thin (it might) or if you want extra crunchy onion rings, dip the onion rings again in the buttermilk mixture and dredge them again in the flour. This double coating will make the onion rings extra crunchy.
Fry in the oil:
Use tongs to place the rings one by one into the hot oil. Fry for a minute on each side, until golden brown.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
When you add the onion rings to the pot, the oil temperature will naturally lower. Adjust the heat so that the temperature of the oil in the pan stays between 350°F and 390°F.
Keep warm in the oven:
Place the fried onion rings on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Keep the fried onion rings warm in a 200°F oven while you fry the rest of the rings.
Add more oil if needed between batches. Let the oil heat back up to 375°F before starting a new batch.
Serve immediately.

Let sandwiches cook over medium-low heat for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, making sure they don’t get too browned. After about 6 to 8 minutes total, the cheese in the sandwich should be well melted and the bread toasted. Done!
Repeat the process for the last two sandwiches. I like to serve the first two to kids while I make the last two for adults, but you can also keep the first two warm in a 200°F oven while you make the last two.

44,How to Make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich,Everything you need to know about making the best grilled cheese sandwich! Mayo or butter? Lid on or off? There's more to a good grilled cheese recipe than you might think!,https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_a_grilled_cheese_sandwich/,"3 ounces (about 2/3 to 1 cup) shredded cheddar, Swiss, Jack, or fontina cheese,2 slices sandwich bread, preferably 1/2-inch thick,2 teaspoons mayonnaise or butter,","Preheat the pan and grate the cheese:
Put a heavy-bottomed medium skillet over medium-low to medium heat (everyone’s stove is a little different). As the skillet heats, grate the cheese. If you are using more than one kind of cheese, toss them together in a bowl until nicely combined.
Mayo or butter the bread:
Spread one side of each slice of bread evenly with mayonnaise or butter. Lay the slices butter-side-down in the preheated skillet.
Alison Bickel
Add the cheese and let it melt:
Distribute the cheese evenly over both slices of bread. If you have a lid for your skillet, put it on; this will help the cheese melt more evenly.
Now, stay put! The second you walk away is the second your sandwich will burn. Look for the cheese to begin melting. The time it takes will depend on your stove, your skillet, and the cheese you are using. Lower-moisture cheeses like aged cheddar will take longer to melt. It could take 2 minutes, or up to 5 minutes. You don’t want the cheese to be totally melted—just halfway melted.
Alison Bickel
Alison Bickel
Close the sandwich and finish grilling:
(If you want to add a filling, like sliced tomato, add it now.) Close the sandwich and continue grilling, flipping the sandwich with a turner as needed, until both sides are golden brown, another 2-3 minutes per side.
Usually, the second side takes less time than the first. Press down on the sandwich gently but firmly with your turner to compact it a little, but don’t smoosh it. You may need to turn the heat down to medium-low to keep the bread from charring.
Peek in the sandwich to see if the cheese is fully melted. If the bread is grilled to your liking but the cheese needs more time, turn the heat down and grill it a few minutes longer.
Alison Bickel
Serve the sandwich:
Cut the sandwich the way you like best (I like cutting on the diagonal, creating four pointy corners to dip in tomato soup) and let it cool a minute or so before eating, unless you like burning your mouth on molten cheese. Serve immediately.;","571

so that the cheese is coated, set aside. The cornstarch will help the cheese from getting too stringy.
Cook the macaroni pasta in boiling water:
Heat 2 quarts of water with a tablespoon of salt to a rolling boil in thick-bottomed saucepan. Add 2 cups of elbow macaroni and follow the cooking time instructions on the package, minus about 2 minutes. (If your macaroni doesn't come with instructions, start checking at 7 minutes).
Cook until al dente—cooked through, but still slightly firm. Drain the pasta.

Add all the macaroni and cheese ingredients to the slow cooker. Reserve one cup of cheddar cheese to top at the end. Stir ingredients together very well.
Nick Evans
Cover and cook on low heat for 90 minutes
Make the Crispy Bacon Topper while the mac and cheese cooks:
In a small skillet over low heat, add chopped bacon. Cook until fat is rendered and the bacon is very crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir it occasionally to evenly cook the bacon.
Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside. Add breadcrumbs and red pepper flakes and stir them into the bacon fat. Continue to cook on low heat until the breadcrumbs are toasted, stirring frequently to prevent burning, about 3 minutes. If the breadcrumbs seem dry, add 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Chop bacon finely and stir into toasted breadcrumbs. (This can be refrigerated for up to a week.)
Check the pasta:
After 90 minutes, lift the lid off the top of the slow cooker. It may look like a solid mass and may trick you into thinking it's done.
Give it a quick stir to incorporate any liquid that may be lingering underneath, making sure the noodles are completely covered or almost completely covered, but not swimming in liquid. Quickly replace the lid, and continue cooking for another 30 minutes on low.
Keep cooking the mac and cheese:
At the 2-hour mark, check the mac and cheese again by stirring it together. Make sure it's loose and creamy but not soupy.
If it is loose and creamy, congratulations: it's ready. If it seems dry and the cheese seems like it's clumping together or not integrating, it means you need more liquid. Add another 1/2 cup of milk, stock, or water, and stir together.
Once you stir that in, it should make the sauce creamy again. Depending on your slow cooker, you may need up to two extra cups of liquid if your macaroni seems dry. And you may need an extra half hour to make it perfect. But it's important to stir and taste. You'll know.
Nick Evans
Top with the reserved cheese:
Once your pasta is cooked and the sauce is the right consistency, stir in the reserved cup of cheddar cheese to make it extra cheesy.
Serve:
Serve the mac and cheese with crispy bacon topper and steamed veggies or a side salad. If you're omitting the bacon topping, taste and see if it needs salt and/or some freshly cracked black pepper.
Leftover macaroni and cheese reheats well in a pot. Add enough water to the empty pot to cover the bottom and let it heat until steaming. Then add cold macaroni and cheese and stir together until creamy and warmed through.
For the love of good macaroni and cheese, please don’t microwave this. Gummy pasta will be the result. It takes just a few minutes to reheat on the stovetop and is worth every minute. Enjoy!

62,Slow Cooker Brat and Beer Cheese Dip,This Slow Cooker Brat and Beer Cheese Dip is the perfect snack for a big football party with friends. Great to serve with pretzels or tortilla chips.,https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/slow_cooker_bratwurst_and_beer_cheese_dip/,"1 (16- to 20-ounce) package beer brats (about 5 links),1/4 cup white onion, minced,2 cloves garlic, minced,12 ounces German beer (pilsners or ambers work well in this recipe),1/4 cup cornstarch,1 1/2 cups whole milk,1 tablespoon Dijon mustard,1 teaspoon kosher salt,1/4 teaspoon white pepper, optional,1 pinch cayenne pepper,1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg,8 ounces Gouda cheese, shredded,6 ounces Asiago cheese, shredded,3 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded,3 ounces goat cheese or chevre, crumbled,2 tablespoons diced pimentos, drained,1 tablespoon cilantro, chopped,Tortilla chips,Pretzels or pretzel bites,Cooked brats cut into 1-inch pieces,","Remove the sausage from its casing:

Marta Rivera
Marta Rivera
Cook the sausages:
In a cast-iron skillet, or other heavy nonstick skillet, brown the brats over medium-high heat and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the meat is cooked through and developing some caramelized spots. Break up the sausages with a wooden spoon or a potato masher as you cook—aim for bite-sized pieces the size of raisins, which are perfect for scooping with chips.
Use a slotted spoon to transfer the browned sausage to your slow cooker. Leave the fat behind in the pan; you will use it for the next step.
Marta Rivera
Marta Rivera
Cook the onions and garlic:
Add the minced onion and garlic to the hot pan and for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables look translucent and glossy.
Marta Rivera
Add the beer:
Lower the heat to medium-low, and carefully pour the beer into the pan. The beer will steam and fizz, so be careful. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits of food that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. This deglazing of the pan is important as it adds tons of flavor to the finished dip.
Bring the liquid to a boil and let it bubble for about 2 to 3 minutes, until slightly reduced. (This also cooks off the alcohol.)
Marta Rivera
Prepare and add the thickener:
While the beer is cooking, whisk together the cornstarch, whole milk, Dijon mustard, salt, white pepper (if using), cayenne pepper, and the ground nutmeg in a mixing bowl to form a smooth mixture.
Once the beer has reduced, carefully pour the cornstarch mixture into the skillet, whisking constantly. Increase the heat to medium and bring the mixture back to a boil. It should thicken quickly.
Once the mixture has the consistency of gravy and the whisk leaves a ribbon when pulled through the sauce, remove the pan from the stove and carefully pour the sauce into the slow cooker.
Marta Rivera
Marta Rivera
Add the cheese to the slow cooker:
Stir the cheese, one type at a time, with the other ingredients in the slow cooker. Make sure to stir thoroughly before adding the next one.
Stir in the drained, diced pimentos.
Marta Rivera
Cook the dip:
Cover the slow cooker and cook the dip on high for 30 minutes to melt the cheese.
Hold the dip on the ""warm"" setting and serve:
Once the cheese has melted completely, switch to the warm setting and stir the dip. Add the chopped cilantro and stir once more. Adjust the seasoning to suit your taste by adding more salt and/or pepper. I've found that the flavors deepen as the dip sits and it may seem to get saltier, so I recommend erring on the side of under-seasoning at this point.
This dip will keep (on warm) for up to 4 hours. Give the dip a stir every half hour or so to prevent a skin from forming on the top. If you feel like it's getting too thick, stir in a little milk to thin it out again.
Marta Rivera
To serve:
Spoon the dip onto individual plates or into bowls. Enjoy with tortilla chips or good ol’ Bavarian-style pretzels!
Leftovers can be stored in a food storage container in the refrigerator for up to two days.
To reheat: Heat on high for 1 minute in the microwave. Stir the dip and reheat at 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until warmed through.;","374

Butter a shallow 3-quart baking dish.
Bake the polenta:
In the baking dish, stir the water, polenta, cubed butter, and salt together. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
Remove from the oven and stir in the half of the cheese. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes longer, or until the polenta is thick and porridge-like.
Turn on the broiler and broil for 1 to 3 minutes, or just until the cheese bubbles and browns.
While the polenta is cooking, heat the grill:
For charcoal grills, fill a grill chimney with charcoal and light it. When the coals are hot (they should be covered with a layer of fine gray ash) empty the coals into the grill and push them to one side of the grill to make higher heat and lower heat cooking zones. Set the grate in place and cover the grill. Preheat the grate for 5 minutes.
For gas grills, heat one burner to high and one to low (225F).
Fold a small piece of paper towel to make a 2-inch square, and pour a few tablespoons of oil into a shallow bowl. With tongs, dip the square into the oil, and brush the grates.
When the grill is ready, cook the vegetables:
Place the sausages on the grill and cook, turning often, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are browned and cooked through (150F is the ideal internal temperature.) Move them on the cooler side of the grill if they brown too quickly but are still raw inside. As soon as they reach the desired temperature, transfer them to a plate and cover loosely with foil to keep them warm.
Brush the zucchini slices, summer squash slices, and tomato halves with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the zucchini and summer squash on each side until the slices are tender and there are grill marks on the sides. Grill the tomatoes, with the cut sides down, until they how grill marks and are warm but not falling apart. Use the cool side of the grill to moderate the heat if necessary.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.
Combine Asiago cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, bread crumbs, parsley, and Kalamata olives in a bowl for the filling. Place about 1/4 of the filling on the center of each chicken breast. Roll up jelly-roll style, securing the edges with toothpicks to keep the chicken breasts from unrolling. Rub the top of each chicken breast with olive oil, place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from oven, tent loosely with foil, and allow to cool for about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and garlic and cook until mushrooms start to brown, about 4 minutes. Add thyme leaves and white wine, stirring and deglazing the skillet, and cook for 2 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in the heavy cream, salt, and pepper. Cook until sauce starts to slightly thicken. Add 1/2 cup Asiago cheese and stir until melted and smooth. Remove from heat immediately; overcooking the Asiago cheese will create a lumpy, stringy sauce.
Slice each chicken breast into 1/2-inch thick slices, and drizzle with Asiago sauce. Garnish with thyme and serve immediately.","599

173,Twice Baked Potatoes,"When is the last time you had Twice Baked Potatoes?!

These are such a good side dish to a holiday meal or Sunday supper.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/twice_baked_potatoes/,"4 large russet potatoes, about 1 pound each,Extra virgin olive oil,1/2 cup sour cream,1/2 cup milk,2 tablespoons butter, softened,1 tablespoon cream,1 cup grated cheddar cheese,4 strips bacon,1/4 cup chopped green onion,1 cup crumbled blue cheese,1/4 cup chopped fresh chives,1/2 teaspoon salt,","Bake the potatoes:
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Scrub the potatoes clean under running water. Poke each potato in several places with the tines of a fork so that when the potatoes are cooking they don't explode.
Rub the potatoes all over with a little olive oil. Place directly on the middle or top rack of the oven.
Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through. They should give a little when pressed.
If short on time you can bake the potatoes in the microwave, 10 minutes on high heat for 2 potatoes, 15 minutes for 4 potatoes. The skins of microwave baked potatoes aren't nearly as crispy, so you may want to rub a little olive oil on them and finish them in a conventional oven at 400°F for 10 minutes.
Alison Bickel
Cook the bacon if using:
If you are including bacon as one of your mix-ins, while the potatoes are cooking, cook the bacon strips in a frying pan on medium low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Let cool. Crumble.
Make potato ""boats"":
Allow the potatoes to cool to touch. Slice the top third lengthwise off the potato.
Use a spoon to scoop out the insides, forming a potato ""canoe"", leaving about 1/4 inch of potato on the skin.
Alternatively, you can slice the potatoes in half, lengthwise. In this case you may want to bake an extra potato so that you will have more potato filling to mound into the potato boats.﻿
Mash potato insides with sour cream, milk, butter:
Place the scooped out potato insides, sour cream, milk, cream, and butter into a large bowl.
Mash with a potato masher. If you want a creamy texture, beat with an electric beater until desired consistency. Do not over-beat the potatoes! They can turn glue-y if you do.
Stuff potato shells with filling:
Mix in the extras with the potato filling. Reserve some of the extras to sprinkle on the tops of the potatoes. Spoon fillings into the potato shells. Sprinkle with extra toppings.
Bake:
Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Place potatoes on a roasting pan or baking sheet and bake 15 to 20 minutes until heated through.;","417

Simple Tip!
Nachos taste best right after they’re made. Leftovers become soggy, stale, and just plain disappointing. Because they’re so easy to scale up or down, I recommend making only enough to eat in one sitting. It’s also not advisable to reheat any nachos that have been topped with sour cream.

Roast hazelnuts:
Place hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet in a 300°F oven for 30 minutes.
Prep celery and dates:
While the nuts are roasting, prepare the other ingredients. Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the tough outer strings of the stalks of celery. Slice the celery stalks on the diagonal into 1/4-inch thick slices.
Slice the dates lengthwise first in half, then slice the halves lengthwise into 3 or four pieces. If the dates are on the large size, you may want to slice them in half widthwise first. You want to end up with pieces that are about an inch long and a 1/4 inch wide.
Rub outer skin off hazelnuts:
Once the hazelnuts have roasted for half an hour, remove them from the oven, let cool for a few minutes. Then rub the hazelnuts together inside of a clean dish towel to remove as much of the outer dark skin as you can.

Glaze hazelnuts:
Melt butter in a small skillet. Add a pinch of cayenne and salt. Add the roasted hazelnuts to the pan and toast them on medium low heat for a few minutes, continuously stirring.

Add all the macaroni and cheese ingredients to the slow cooker. Reserve one cup of cheddar cheese to top at the end. Stir ingredients together very well.
Nick Evans
Cover and cook on low heat for 90 minutes
Make the Crispy Bacon Topper while the mac and cheese cooks:
In a small skillet over low heat, add chopped bacon. Cook until fat is rendered and the bacon is very crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir it occasionally to evenly cook the bacon.
Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside. Add breadcrumbs and red pepper flakes and stir them into the bacon fat. Continue to cook on low heat until the breadcrumbs are toasted, stirring frequently to prevent burning, about 3 minutes. If the breadcrumbs seem dry, add 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Chop bacon finely and stir into toasted breadcrumbs. (This can be refrigerated for up to a week.)
Check the pasta:
After 90 minutes, lift the lid off the top of the slow cooker. It may look like a solid mass and may trick you into thinking it's done.
Give it a quick stir to incorporate any liquid that may be lingering underneath, making sure the noodles are completely covered or almost completely covered, but not swimming in liquid. Quickly replace the lid, and continue cooking for another 30 minutes on low.
Keep cooking the mac and cheese:
At the 2-hour mark, check the mac and cheese again by stirring it together. Make sure it's loose and creamy but not soupy.
If it is loose and creamy, congratulations: it's ready. If it seems dry and the cheese seems like it's clumping together or not integrating, it means you need more liquid. Add another 1/2 cup of milk, stock, or water, and stir together.
Once you stir that in, it should make the sauce creamy again. Depending on your slow cooker, you may need up to two extra cups of liquid if your macaroni seems dry. And you may need an extra half hour to make it perfect. But it's important to stir and taste. You'll know.
Nick Evans
Top with the reserved cheese:
Once your pasta is cooked and the sauce is the right consistency, stir in the reserved cup of cheddar cheese to make it extra cheesy.
Serve:
Serve the mac and cheese with crispy bacon topper and steamed veggies or a side salad. If you're omitting the bacon topping, taste and see if it needs salt and/or some freshly cracked black pepper.
Leftover macaroni and cheese reheats well in a pot. Add enough water to the empty pot to cover the bottom and let it heat until steaming. Then add cold macaroni and cheese and stir together until creamy and warmed through.
For the love of good macaroni and cheese, please don’t microwave this. Gummy pasta will be the result. It takes just a few minutes to reheat on the stovetop and is worth every minute. Enjoy!

Add the béchamel to the vegetables
Pour the warm béchamel over the top of the vegetables in the gratin dish and let sit for at least 15 minutes to allow the sauce to soak into the vegetables.

In a medium bowl, add goat cheese, yogurt, milk, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Use a hand mixer or a stand mixer to whip the goat cheese mixture until it has a smooth, light consistency. (If you don’t have a hand mixer or stand mixer, you can use a fork to mash the ingredients together, but they won't have the same whipped consistency.)

Assemble the dip:
Spread the whipped goat cheese in a thin, even layer along the bottom of a 2 1/2-quart baking dish or an 8 x 8-inch baking dish. It shouldn’t be more than 1/2-inch thick in any part of the dip. Drizzle the honey over the dip; then sprinkle the bacon, golden raisins, pistachios, dates, sunflower seeds, and minced chives evenly over the top.

Arrange the red peppers on a broiling pan and place them under a hot broiler so that their upper surfaces are about 1/2 inch from the heat.
Broil for 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the peppers are blistered and black on all sides. (You can alternatively blacken the peppers directly over the open flame of a gas cook-top, holding them and turning them with tongs.)
Place them in a bowl and cover the bowl with a plate. Let the peppers steam in their own residual heat inside the bowl for 10 minutes. Then peel them (the skin will slide off) and remove the seeds.
Note that Trader Joe's makes an excellent bottled cooked red pepper that can be used as a shortcut to the above step.
Grill the eggplants:
Heat a grill or grill pan until very hot. Cut the eggplants into 1/2-inch slices and lay out flat on a large flat surface such as a baking pan. Brush the slices on both sides with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt.
Cook the eggplant slices on the grill, covered, for 4 minutes on each side, until they are nicely browned and softened. If your grill does not have a lid, make a tent-like lid of aluminum foil and place it over the eggplant as it cooks.
Blanch the parsley:
While the eggplant is grilling, soften the parsley by blanching it in boiling water for 5 to 10 seconds. Remove, cool under cold water, drain.
Build the terrine:
Line a terrine mold (loaf pan) with plastic wrap. Arrange a layer of eggplant in the bottom of the mold and top it with about a third each of the red pepper pieces, parsley, and cheese.
Repeat, beginning and ending with a layer of eggplant, until all the ingredients are used.
Cover with plastic wrap and press down on the wrap to compact the mixture. Refrigerate.
At this point you can make the terrine in advance and store in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve it.
Prepare the sauce:
Place the garlic and tomatoes in a blender and blend until smooth. Push the mixture through a food mill (fitted with a fine screen) over a bowl. Add the remainder of the sauce ingredients. Mix well.
Serve:
To serve, pour some of the sauce on a large platter and un-mold the terrine in the center. Cut it into slices and serve with the remainder of the sauce.

It will become your new favorite holiday starter!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/focaccia_with_caramelized_onions_cranberries_and_brie/,"4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour,1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast,1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt,1 3/4 cups (350g) lukewarm water,1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan,3 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced,1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar,1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, for brushing on top,10 ounces brie, cut into cubes (scrape rind off with a paring knife if desired, though it’s not necessary),1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries,1 tablespoon fresh rosemary,","Make the dough:
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all the dough ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the dough, though I sometimes knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate the last of the flour.
Cover and let it rise for 1-2 hours at room temperature. Use it right away, or transfer to the fridge overnight.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Press out the dough:
Film a half-sheet pan or baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil and pat the dough out so that it fills the entire pan. If it springs back, wait a few minutes and then continue patting it out. Let the dough rise uncovered until puffy—about 1/2 hour for room temperature dough, or an hour for refrigerated dough.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Caramelize the onions:
Meanwhile, warm 2 teaspoons of butter or olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions with 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep brown. This will take 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and remove from heat. Let the onions cool slightly.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Preheat the oven:

Preheat the oven to 425°F.
Top the focaccia:
Uncover the dough and brush the top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil, paying special attention to the edges and corners. Gently dimple the top of the focaccia all over by pressing your fingertips about halfway down into the dough.
Scatter the onions over top. Dot the cubes of brie evenly over the onions, followed by the cranberries. Finish by sprinkling the rosemary over top along with as much black pepper as you like.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Bake:
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the bottom of the crust is golden (lift it up with a spatula to check). If the toppings start to brown too much before the bottom of the crust is golden, cover the pan loosely with foil.

Stir the ingredients together and heat over medium-high heat for 3 minutes, or until the mixture starts to boil.
Reduce the topping:
Reduce the heat to low, and allow the cranberries to cook until they begin to split open. Stirring frequently, cook the cranberries for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they've reduced a bit and thickened to a jelly-like consistency.
Remove the pan from the stove and add the light brown sugar. Stir constantly to dissolve the sugar and coat the cranberries in a thick glaze.
Allow the cranberries to cool to room temperature, leaving the spices in it.
Prep your air fryer:
Set your Cuisinart® Air Fryer Toaster Oven’s function dial to Air Fry and the temperature dial to 300°F. Remove both the Air Fryer basket and the baking pan from the oven, then turn the on/oven dial to 10 minutes to preheat the oven.
Fill the phyllo cups:
While your Air Fryer is heating, fill your phyllo shells with the pieces of brie. It’s easier to leave the shells in the packaging while you’re trying to fill them. Remove the shells from the plastic packaging and arrange them, a dozen at a time, in the Air Fryer basket.
Bake the shells:
Place the baking pan, with the Air Fryer basket nestled inside, into the oven in position 1. Bake the shells for five minutes.
Once the shells have finished baking, remove them from the Air Fryer Toaster Oven and carefully remove them from the basket. Repeat this step, baking the shells by the dozen, until they are all baked.
Prep the rosemary topping:
While the shells are baking, pick off the remaining rosemary leaves in clusters of two or three leaves. Set aside to garnish the canapés later.
Top with cranberry sauce and garnish:
Once you have baked all of the brie-filled shells, top each with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, leaving the cinnamon stick, vanilla bean (if you used one), rosemary sprigs and slices of ginger in the pan. Pull out any pieces of rosemary. (Any remaining cranberry sauce may be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.)
Garnish the top of each canapé with the sprigs of rosemary leaves you picked earlier.
Serve immediately:
These canapés are best served immediately, but can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours.;",

Fill the molds:
Use a small amount of oil or nonstick cooking spray to grease a silicone egg mold, then ladle 1/4 cup of the mixture into each of the impressions in the mold. Wipe off any drips.
Coco Morante
Prepare the pressure cooker:
Pour 1 cup of water into the Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker. Carefully transfer the egg mold to the wire steam rack, then place an 8-inch parchment round or piece of aluminum foil on top of the mold to keep condensation from dripping onto the bites as they cook.
Grasping the handles of the steam rack, lower the egg mold into the pot.
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Cook the eggs on low pressure:
Secure the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the “Sealing” position. Select the “Pressure Cook” or “Manual” program, then adjust the time to 8 minutes at low pressure.
(If making a double batch, increase the cooking time to 10 minutes.)
The pressure cooker will take about 10 minutes to come up to full pressure. Cook time begins once it has reached full pressure.
Note: If you don’t have a low pressure option on your pressure cooker, use the 'Pressure Cook' or 'Manual' setting for 8 minutes. We recommend only doing one layer of egg bites at a time this way. You can also try setting the “Steam” function for 10 minutes.

Release the pressure naturally for 5 minutes:
When the timer goes off, let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes, then perform a quick pressure release by moving the pressure release knob from “Sealing” to “Venting.” It will take a minute or two for the pressure to release completely.
Coco Morante
Remove the egg bites from the pressure cooker:
Wearing heatproof mitts, grasp the ends of the wire rack to lift the egg bite mold out of the pot. Remove the sheet of parchment and let the bites cool for 2 minutes or so (they will deflate a bit as they cool). Use a spoon to scoop the bites out of the mold and transfer them to a serving dish.
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Serve the egg bites:
Serve the bites warm on their own, or with toast or a pile of mixed greens.

This beautiful baked stuffed brie takes that principle to the next level.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/245731/baked-stuffed-brie-with-cranberries-walnuts/,"1 small wheel of brie (about 6 to 8 inches), chilled,¼ cup dried cranberries,¼ cup chopped walnuts,1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed, plus extra for (optional) design,1 egg, beaten with,1 teaspoon water,","Directions
Score the side of a wheel of brie all the way around with a sharp paring knife. Cut directly on the ""equator"" through the rind. Using a long piece of string or dental floss, wrap the string around the brie on the newly made cut. Loop one end of the string over the other (a half knot). Then pulling the ends of the string in opposite directions, cut the brie in half.
Press the dried cranberries on one cut side of the brie, and the walnuts on the other. Quickly put the 2 sides back together with the cranberries on top of the walnuts. Press together and stuff back in any cranberries or walnuts that fell out.
Roll out a thawed sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Place brie in center of pastry. Gently pull up edges to ensure you have enough dough to entirely wrap the brie. You can trim off the corners if there is too much dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Fold one edge of the dough over the brie and then the opposite side. Fold over the remaining edges and complexly encase the brie. You can trim off excess pieces of dough, if necessary. Flip the brie over so the seam is at the bottom; gently press in the sides to snug the dough against the brie. Brush the top and sides of the wrapped brie with egg wash.
If you choose to decorate the brie with cut-out shapes of additional puff pastry, use very cold (almost still frozen) dough to ensure sharp lines. Lightly brush the decorative pieces with egg wash. Place the brie in the freezer for one hour (this is a crucial step; see note below).
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the brie on the prepared baking sheet. Bake on the center rack in preheated oven until it is browned and leaking cheese, about 20 minutes. (Only rarely does the brie not leak through, but 20 to 25 minutes is about how long it takes to melt the cheese and brown the pastry.)
Chef John
Cook's Note:
Do not skip the freezing-for-one hour step. The crust needs to bake to a golden brown before the brie starts pouring out, so it must be partially frozen when it goes in the oven. If you happen to make it ahead of time, and put it in the oven frozen solid, then I'd lower the temp to 400, and give it an extra 10 minutes or so, or until the cheese is runny.","304

The puff pastry will rise in the cup as it bakes, so don't overfill the bites with a big cube of cheese or too much lemon curd. If any lemon curd does spill over the muffin cup, you can give it an extra dollop of the lemon curd, refilling, before finishing with the blueberry and mint leaf.","72

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet; cook and stir the onion in the butter until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar and cook until the sugar completely melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely.
Mix together the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Whisk together the egg and water in a small bowl. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour; shake off the excess flour and then dip the chicken in the egg and water mixture.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
Place 2 of the chicken breast halves in the bottom of a baking dish. Top each with about half the brie and half the caramelized onions. Lie the remaining chicken breast halves atop the brie and onions.
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.
While the chicken bakes, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Allow the butter to brown slightly before adding the vermouth; bring to a simmer and allow to cook until the liquid reduces by about half. Season with the thyme, salt, and pepper.

Score the side of a wheel of brie all the way around with a sharp paring knife. Cut directly on the ""equator"" through the rind. Using a long piece of string or dental floss, wrap the string around the brie on the newly made cut. Loop one end of the string over the other (a half knot). Then pulling the ends of the string in opposite directions, cut the brie in half.
Press the dried cranberries on one cut side of the brie, and the walnuts on the other. Quickly put the 2 sides back together with the cranberries on top of the walnuts. Press together and stuff back in any cranberries or walnuts that fell out.
Roll out a thawed sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Place brie in center of pastry. Gently pull up edges to ensure you have enough dough to entirely wrap the brie. You can trim off the corners if there is too much dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Fold one edge of the dough over the brie and then the opposite side. Fold over the remaining edges and complexly encase the brie. You can trim off excess pieces of dough, if necessary. Flip the brie over so the seam is at the bottom; gently press in the sides to snug the dough against the brie. Brush the top and sides of the wrapped brie with egg wash.
If you choose to decorate the brie with cut-out shapes of additional puff pastry, use very cold (almost still frozen) dough to ensure sharp lines. Lightly brush the decorative pieces with egg wash. Place the brie in the freezer for one hour (this is a crucial step; see note below).
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the brie on the prepared baking sheet. Bake on the center rack in preheated oven until it is browned and leaking cheese, about 20 minutes. (Only rarely does the brie not leak through, but 20 to 25 minutes is about how long it takes to melt the cheese and brown the pastry.)
Chef John
Cook's Note:
Do not skip the freezing-for-one hour step. The crust needs to bake to a golden brown before the brie starts pouring out, so it must be partially frozen when it goes in the oven. If you happen to make it ahead of time, and put it in the oven frozen solid, then I'd lower the temp to 400, and give it an extra 10 minutes or so, or until the cheese is runny.","304

The puff pastry will rise in the cup as it bakes, so don't overfill the bites with a big cube of cheese or too much lemon curd. If any lemon curd does spill over the muffin cup, you can give it an extra dollop of the lemon curd, refilling, before finishing with the blueberry and mint leaf.","72

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet; cook and stir the onion in the butter until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar and cook until the sugar completely melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely.
Mix together the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Whisk together the egg and water in a small bowl. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour; shake off the excess flour and then dip the chicken in the egg and water mixture.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
Place 2 of the chicken breast halves in the bottom of a baking dish. Top each with about half the brie and half the caramelized onions. Lie the remaining chicken breast halves atop the brie and onions.
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.
While the chicken bakes, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Allow the butter to brown slightly before adding the vermouth; bring to a simmer and allow to cook until the liquid reduces by about half. Season with the thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir the arrowroot into the mixture to thicken. Serve the sauce over the chicken.

Score the side of a wheel of brie all the way around with a sharp paring knife. Cut directly on the ""equator"" through the rind. Using a long piece of string or dental floss, wrap the string around the brie on the newly made cut. Loop one end of the string over the other (a half knot). Then pulling the ends of the string in opposite directions, cut the brie in half.
Press the dried cranberries on one cut side of the brie, and the walnuts on the other. Quickly put the 2 sides back together with the cranberries on top of the walnuts. Press together and stuff back in any cranberries or walnuts that fell out.
Roll out a thawed sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Place brie in center of pastry. Gently pull up edges to ensure you have enough dough to entirely wrap the brie. You can trim off the corners if there is too much dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Fold one edge of the dough over the brie and then the opposite side. Fold over the remaining edges and complexly encase the brie. You can trim off excess pieces of dough, if necessary. Flip the brie over so the seam is at the bottom; gently press in the sides to snug the dough against the brie. Brush the top and sides of the wrapped brie with egg wash.
If you choose to decorate the brie with cut-out shapes of additional puff pastry, use very cold (almost still frozen) dough to ensure sharp lines. Lightly brush the decorative pieces with egg wash. Place the brie in the freezer for one hour (this is a crucial step; see note below).
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the brie on the prepared baking sheet. Bake on the center rack in preheated oven until it is browned and leaking cheese, about 20 minutes. (Only rarely does the brie not leak through, but 20 to 25 minutes is about how long it takes to melt the cheese and brown the pastry.)
Chef John
Cook's Note:
Do not skip the freezing-for-one hour step. The crust needs to bake to a golden brown before the brie starts pouring out, so it must be partially frozen when it goes in the oven. If you happen to make it ahead of time, and put it in the oven frozen solid, then I'd lower the temp to 400, and give it an extra 10 minutes or so, or until the cheese is runny.","304

Finger food at its best!",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/286273/brie-lemon-curd-and-blueberry-bites/,"cooking spray,1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed,½ (8 ounce) round Brie cheese, chilled,⅓ cup lemon curd,24 fresh blueberries,confectioners' sugar for dusting,24 small fresh mint leaves for garnish (optional),","Directions
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a mini muffin tin with cooking spray and set aside.
Unroll thawed puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a large rectangular sheet, and using a pizza cutter or knife, cut into 24 equal pieces. Press each piece into a muffin cup, and use a fork to prick the bottom several times.
Cut Brie cheese into 24 small cubes, and place a cube into each muffin cup. Top each with about 1/2 teaspoon of lemon curd.
Place muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake until the pastry is puffed and the corners turn golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.
Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for about 5 minutes. Remove bites to a serving plate, top each with a blueberry, dust with confectioners' sugar, and garnish with a small mint leaf, if desired.
Enjoy warm or at room temperature.
Cook's Note:
The puff pastry will rise in the cup as it bakes, so don't overfill the bites with a big cube of cheese or too much lemon curd. If any lemon curd does spill over the muffin cup, you can give it an extra dollop of the lemon curd, refilling, before finishing with the blueberry and mint leaf.","72

Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet; cook and stir the onion in the butter until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar and cook until the sugar completely melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely.
Mix together the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Whisk together the egg and water in a small bowl. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour; shake off the excess flour and then dip the chicken in the egg and water mixture.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
Place 2 of the chicken breast halves in the bottom of a baking dish. Top each with about half the brie and half the caramelized onions. Lie the remaining chicken breast halves atop the brie and onions.
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.
While the chicken bakes, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Allow the butter to brown slightly before adding the vermouth; bring to a simmer and allow to cook until the liquid reduces by about half. Season with the thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir the arrowroot into the mixture to thicken. Serve the sauce over the chicken.

Score the side of a wheel of brie all the way around with a sharp paring knife. Cut directly on the ""equator"" through the rind. Using a long piece of string or dental floss, wrap the string around the brie on the newly made cut. Loop one end of the string over the other (a half knot). Then pulling the ends of the string in opposite directions, cut the brie in half.
Press the dried cranberries on one cut side of the brie, and the walnuts on the other. Quickly put the 2 sides back together with the cranberries on top of the walnuts. Press together and stuff back in any cranberries or walnuts that fell out.
Roll out a thawed sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Place brie in center of pastry. Gently pull up edges to ensure you have enough dough to entirely wrap the brie. You can trim off the corners if there is too much dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Fold one edge of the dough over the brie and then the opposite side. Fold over the remaining edges and complexly encase the brie. You can trim off excess pieces of dough, if necessary. Flip the brie over so the seam is at the bottom; gently press in the sides to snug the dough against the brie. Brush the top and sides of the wrapped brie with egg wash.
If you choose to decorate the brie with cut-out shapes of additional puff pastry, use very cold (almost still frozen) dough to ensure sharp lines. Lightly brush the decorative pieces with egg wash. Place the brie in the freezer for one hour (this is a crucial step; see note below).
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the brie on the prepared baking sheet. Bake on the center rack in preheated oven until it is browned and leaking cheese, about 20 minutes. (Only rarely does the brie not leak through, but 20 to 25 minutes is about how long it takes to melt the cheese and brown the pastry.)
Chef John
Cook's Note:
Do not skip the freezing-for-one hour step. The crust needs to bake to a golden brown before the brie starts pouring out, so it must be partially frozen when it goes in the oven. If you happen to make it ahead of time, and put it in the oven frozen solid, then I'd lower the temp to 400, and give it an extra 10 minutes or so, or until the cheese is runny.","304

Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet; cook and stir the onion in the butter until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar and cook until the sugar completely melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely.
Mix together the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Whisk together the egg and water in a small bowl. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour; shake off the excess flour and then dip the chicken in the egg and water mixture.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
Place 2 of the chicken breast halves in the bottom of a baking dish. Top each with about half the brie and half the caramelized onions. Lie the remaining chicken breast halves atop the brie and onions.
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.

307,Baked Stuffed Brie with Cranberries & Walnuts,"One of the most common mistakes people make when serving cheese is not letting it come to room temperature first, so that all the flavors can be fully realized. This beautiful baked stuffed brie takes that principle to the next level.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/245731/baked-stuffed-brie-with-cranberries-walnuts/,"1 small wheel of brie (about 6 to 8 inches), chilled,¼ cup dried cranberries,¼ cup chopped walnuts,1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed, plus extra for (optional) design,1 egg, beaten with,1 teaspoon water,","Directions
Score the side of a wheel of brie all the way around with a sharp paring knife. Cut directly on the ""equator"" through the rind. Using a long piece of string or dental floss, wrap the string around the brie on the newly made cut. Loop one end of the string over the other (a half knot). Then pulling the ends of the string in opposite directions, cut the brie in half.
Press the dried cranberries on one cut side of the brie, and the walnuts on the other. Quickly put the 2 sides back together with the cranberries on top of the walnuts. Press together and stuff back in any cranberries or walnuts that fell out.
Roll out a thawed sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Place brie in center of pastry. Gently pull up edges to ensure you have enough dough to entirely wrap the brie. You can trim off the corners if there is too much dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Fold one edge of the dough over the brie and then the opposite side. Fold over the remaining edges and complexly encase the brie. You can trim off excess pieces of dough, if necessary. Flip the brie over so the seam is at the bottom; gently press in the sides to snug the dough against the brie. Brush the top and sides of the wrapped brie with egg wash.
If you choose to decorate the brie with cut-out shapes of additional puff pastry, use very cold (almost still frozen) dough to ensure sharp lines. Lightly brush the decorative pieces with egg wash. Place the brie in the freezer for one hour (this is a crucial step; see note below).
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the brie on the prepared baking sheet. Bake on the center rack in preheated oven until it is browned and leaking cheese, about 20 minutes. (Only rarely does the brie not leak through, but 20 to 25 minutes is about how long it takes to melt the cheese and brown the pastry.)
Chef John
Cook's Note:
Do not skip the freezing-for-one hour step. The crust needs to bake to a golden brown before the brie starts pouring out, so it must be partially frozen when it goes in the oven. If you happen to make it ahead of time, and put it in the oven frozen solid, then I'd lower the temp to 400, and give it an extra 10 minutes or so, or until the cheese is runny.","304

Our apple butter recipe is great on toast or spooned into oatmeal!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/apple_butter/,"4 pounds good cooking apples (we use Granny Smith or Gravenstein),1 cup apple cider vinegar,2 cups water,Sugar (about 4 cups, see cooking instructions),2 teaspoons cinnamon,1/2 teaspoon ground cloves,1/2 teaspoon allspice,1 tablespoon lemon zest,3 tablespoons lemon juice,Pinch kosher salt,","Quarter the apples:
Cut the apples into quarters without peeling or coring them. Much of the pectin is in the cores and flavor in the peels. Cut out damaged parts.
Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe
Cook the apples:
Put the quartered apples into large pot, add the vinegar and water, cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cook until apples are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe
Push the apples through a food mill:
Ladle apple mixture (cooked apples and liquid) into a chinois sieve (or food mill) and using a pestle force pulp from the chinois into a large bowl below.
Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe
Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe
Add sugar, spices, lemon zest, and juice:
Measure resulting apple pulp. Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of sugar for each cup of apple pulp. Stir to dissolve sugar. Add cinnamon, ground cloves, allspice, lemon zest, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.
Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe
Cook the apple mixture and stir often:
Cook the apple sugar mixture uncovered in a large, wide, thick-bottomed pot on medium low heat, stirring often to prevent burning. Scrape the bottom of the pot while you stir to make sure a crust is not forming at the bottom.
Cook until thick, smooth, and dark brown in color (about 1 to 2 hours). A small bit spooned onto a chilled (in the freezer) plate will be thick, not runny.
You can also cook the puree on low heat, stirring only occasionally, but this will take much longer as stirring encourages evaporation. (Note the wider the pan the better, as there is more surface for evaporation.)
If you went with the lower amount of sugar, taste the apple butter and add a little more sugar if you think it needs it.

Simple Tip!
Try giving this apple butter a day two to age before you enjoy it. On the day it's made, it can taste quite sharp. After a few days, it mellows out and the flavors meld.
How To Can the Apple Butter
Prep the canning jars:
Midway through cooking the apple butter down, place a steamer rack in a large stockpot, and place 6 to 8 (8-ounce) canning jars on the rack. Fill the jars and the pot with water up to the rim of the jars.
Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
Wash the lids in hot, soapy water.
Simple Tip!
Because the jars will be processed in a water bath for 10 minutes, you do not need to sterilize the jars. They do, however, need to be warm.
Pour the apple butter into hot jars and seal:
Remove the jars from the water bath using jar lifters. Fill the hot jars with the hot apple butter, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Screw on the lids so they are fingertip tight.
Lower the jars into the boiling water bath. If needed, add enough water to cover the tops of the jars with at least 1 inch of water. When the water returns to a boil, process in the water bath for 10 minutes.
Remove the jars from the water bath and set on a clean dishtowel. As the jars cool, you should hear the lids ""popping"" as they seal the jars.

Scoop the cookies:
Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop and place the cookie dough on the lined parchment baking sheet. If you don’t have a cookie scoop, use a tablespoon measure and scoop well-mounded tablespoons of dough for each cookie.
You can either leave them the shape of the scoop or shape them by gently rolling and flattening between your palms.
Cindy Rahe
Make the peanut butter drizzle (optional):
If you'd like to add the peanut butter drizzle, melt the peanut butter and coconut oil together in the microwave for 30 seconds. Stir to combine, then drizzle over the cookies using a spoon.
Skip this drizzle if you're planning to pack up the cookies for eating on the go; the drizzle softens a little when the cookies are at room temperature, which can make them a little messy when eating on the go.
Cindy Rahe
Refrigerate for 20 minutes to firm up the cookies and set the drizzle:
Transfer to an airtight container.
Cookies will keep for about a week at room temperature, or a month if refrigerated. If you added the peanut butter drizzle, keep refrigerated so the drizzle stays firm.

319,How to Make Brown Butter,Take your recipes up a notch with the nutty aroma of browned butter. It's easy!,https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_brown_butter/,"1 stick (8 tablespoons, 113g) unsalted butter,","Melt the butter:

Simply Recipes / Cambrea Bakes
Simply Recipes / Cambrea Bakes

Once melted the butter will foam up a bit, then subside. Watch carefully as lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. Smell the butter; it should have a nutty aroma.
Simply Recipes / Cambrea Bakes
Simply Recipes / Cambrea Bakes
Simply Recipes / Cambrea Bakes
Remove from the heat:
Pour into a bowl to stop the butter from cooking further and perhaps burning.
It's pretty easy to overcook browned butter and go from brown to burnt. If the butter starts to blacken, I suggest dumping it and starting over (something I've had to do on occasion), unless you want beurre noir which has a different taste than nutty brown butter.
Use browned butter immediately or store covered in the refrigerator for future use.
Simple Tip!
If you want to make sage brown butter sauce, add some fresh sage leaves to the butter once it has melted. Allow the butter to brown and remove from the heat.

320,"Nut-Free ""Peanut Butter"" Chocolate Chip Cookies","Looking for an allergy-friendly cookie recipe? Look no further than these nut-free ""peanut butter"" cookies! They're made with sunflower butter and other allergy-friendly ingredients so everyone can enjoy.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/nut_free_peanut_butter_chocolate_chip_cookies/,,"Prepare the flax ""egg"":
Combine the flax meal with 2 1/2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let stand for 7 to 10 minutes to thicken. This will be used as an egg replacer in this recipe.
Combine the oil and sugars:
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using electric hand beaters), beat the coconut oil, brown sugar, and sugar until smooth and combined.
The mixture will be a little grainy and will flatten to cover the bottom of the bowl in a uniform layer; it won’t be light and creamy like more traditional cookie batters. Scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times and continue mixing until the sugar is well incorporated.
Add the sunflower butter, flax egg and vanilla:
and beat until combined. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides as needed. Beat for 1 to 2 minutes—it’ll start to soften and look much more creamy at this point.
Whisk together the dry ingredients:
In a small, separate mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt.
Beat in the dry ingredients:
Slowly add the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl and beat on medium until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. The dough will look like large pebbles at first, but keep beating and it will eventually become smooth and more uniform in about 2 minutes.
Turn off the mixer and knead the dough a few times with your hands to ensure all the dry bits come up from the bottom of the bowl and are incorporated.
Work in the chocolate chips:
Incorporate chocolate chips with your hands by kneading and mixing them gently into the dough.
This dough isn’t sticky and creamy like some traditional cookie doughs, so hand-mixing like this is the best method to incorporate the chips. Don’t worry if a few chips are loose; they’ll make their way into the cookies when you scoop out the dough.
Chill the dough:
Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, or up to overnight.
Preheat the oven and prepare the pan:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Warm the dough slightly:
After chilling, remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Because the dough is a bit crumbly, letting it sit out on the counter before forming it into balls will help ensure you have nice, smooth cookie dough balls to work with versus ones that may crack a bit if they’re too cool.
Roll into cookies:
Using 2 heaping tablespoons (about 45g) of dough per cookie, roll the dough in between your hands until it forms a ball. It doesn’t need to be perfect—if the dough crumbles a little, just press it back together.
Place each ball on a parchment-lined baking sheet spaced about 1 1/2 inches apart (they'll spread a bit). Using the palm of your hand, flatten each cookie slightly to about 1/2-inch thickness. If the cookies start to crack or break as you flatten them, just use your hands to form them back together.
Bake cookies:
Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges just begin to turn golden brown. The cookies will still feel soft but will firm up as they cool.
Cool and serve:
Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Store leftovers:
Keep the cookies covered at room temperature for up to 5 days. Freeze in an airtight freezer bag or container for up to 3 months.;",

Rest the batter while your waffle iron warms:
Cover the batter with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for at least five minutes while you warm the waffle iron. The waffle iron is ready when a drop of water sizzles on contact with the griddle.
Make the waffles:
Brush the waffle iron with melted butter, if you like. This helps give your waffles a golden color and prevents sticking, but isn't crucial for the recipe. Scoop 1/3 to 1/2 cup of batter into each grid of the waffle iron and cook until golden, according to your waffle iron's instructions.

Transfer the cooked waffles to the oven:
When the waffles are done, transfer them to the cooling rack on the baking sheet in the oven. Place them in one single layer so that they crisp evenly on top and bottom, and so steam isn't trapped between layers. Let them toast for 5 to 10 minutes.

368,How to Make Gluten-Free Biscuits,"Gluten-free buttermilk biscuits are happening! If you can't eat gluten and seriously miss a warm and flaky biscuit, we've got you covered.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_fluffy_gluten_free_biscuits/,,"Combine dry ingredients:
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.
Alison Conklin
Add the butter:
On the low speed, let the mixer break up the butter into smaller pieces; this should take about a minute. Stop the mixer and check; you still want visible pieces of butter about the size of marbles or even a little bigger. They will look like they are starting to flatten.
This dough is not a situation where we say the flour and butter should look like “the consistency of small peas.” If some of the pieces haven't flattened, just press them between your fingertips to break them up a little bit—dime-sized pieces are fine.
Alison Conklin
Add the buttermilk:
Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and add 2 tablespoons of buttermilk. Using a fork, quickly mix the buttermilk into the flour to hydrate it.
Then, slowly mix in a scant 3/4 cup of buttermilk and combine with a fork until no streaks of flour remain. If the dough seems dry, add additional buttermilk a tablespoon at a time and incorporate before adding more. You don't want a wet dough.
Alison Conklin
Gather the dough into a ball:
On a floured surface, turn out the dough, which will look like a crumbly mess. It will come together when you begin to shape it into a ball. If for some reason (ambient humidity, variations in buttermilk thickness) the dough feels dry, add a couple of tablespoons of buttermilk to hydrate those dry bits.
Alison Conklin
Alison Conklin
Fold the dough like a letter:
Lightly press the dough (or roll it with a floured rolling pin) into a thick rectangular shape, about 4 inches by 6 inches. Fold one of the short ends of the dough toward the middle, and then the other, like a letter.
Rotate the dough 1/4 turn and roll it out, and fold it again into thirds. Repeat this process one more time, then wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1/2 hour to an hour. (This process creates flaky layers; if you skip it, your biscuits will bake flat, like hockey pucks.)
Alison Conklin
Prep the oven and pan:
Preheat the oven to 425°F and prep a 9- or 10-inch cast iron pan or an 8x8 glass baking dish with either spray oil or grease with butter.
Roll and cut out the biscuits:
Remove the dough from the fridge and, using a rolling pin, gently roll it out to a rectangle about 6 inches by 9 inches and one inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter that’s been lightly floured (this dough can be sticky), cut out about 6 biscuits by pressing the cutter straight down into the dough; if you twist them when you remove them, you’ll stunt their rise!
Reroll the scraps, reflouring the biscuit cutter if needed, and make more biscuits until all the dough is used up.
Transfer to the pan. You will have to nestle them close to each other, and that’s okay. You want them touching in order for them to rise better. Brush the tops with the melted butter.
Alison Conklin

Bake:
Bake the biscuits for 20 to 25 minutes until the tops look lightly brown around the edges. Check frequently to avoid burning.
Cool and serve:
Remove from the oven and brush the tops with melted butter. Let the biscuits cool in the pan for about 5 to 10 minutes before removing from the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Try to wait the seemingly impossible 10 minutes before you eat one. They will continue to cook a little, firm up a little while cooling, and not burn your mouth. It’s all worth the wait.
These biscuits are best eaten warm out of the oven, but they do okay reheated in a toaster or low oven (300°F) for up to 2 days. They get dried out pretty fast.;",
369,Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes,"Looking for a gluten-free breakfast that tastes great and is easy to make? Well, look no further than these Oatmeal Pancakes. No special ingredients required — just rolled oats!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/oatmeal_buttermilk_pancakes/,,"Grind the oats:
Set aside 1/2 cup of the oats to add to the batter later. In a food processor, grind the remaining 2 1/2 cups oats until the mixture resembles coarse whole-wheat flour, with a few particles of oats.
Sally Vargas
Make the batter:
Add the baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, eggs, 1 1/2 cups of the buttermilk, oil or melted butter, honey, and vanilla to the food processor bowl and pulse a few times, until blended.
Pour the batter into a bowl and stir in the remaining 1/2 cup oats. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. The mixture will not be not completely smooth, and it will thicken as it sits. If the batter becomes too thick at any point feel free to thin with some of the remaining buttermilk.
Sally Vargas
Heat a skillet or griddle:
Pour a few drops of oil into the skillet or griddle and spread with a paper towel. Set the pan over medium heat. The pan is hot enough when you drop a few drops of water on it and they sizzle. Turn the heat to medium-low.
Cook the pancakes:
Ladle about 1/3 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. With the back of the ladle, spread the batter into 4-inch circles. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until bubbles form on top and the bottoms look brown when you peek under the pancakes with a spatula. Turn them and cook for another 2 minutes, or until browned. Repeat until all the batter is used.
Sally Vargas
Serve the pancakes:
Serve them hot off the griddle or keep them warm in a 325°F oven on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve with lots of butter, fresh fruit (if you wish), and maple syrup.;",

Cook the bacon:
Cut the bacon into 1/2 inch pieces. Put in a frying pan and heat on medium. Cook until the fat has rendered and the bacon is well browned. Remove bacon to a paper towel lined plate.
Note: Do not pour rendered fat down your kitchen sink unless you really like your plumber. Pour it into a jar to use for another cooking purpose or discard.

Don’t let the simplicity fool you — it’s a real keeper and takes less than 45 minutes.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/irish_soda_bread/,"4 to 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour,1 tablespoon sugar,1 teaspoon salt,1 teaspoon baking soda,4 tablespoons butter, cubed and slightly softened,1 cup currants or raisins,1 large egg, lightly beaten,1 3/4 cups buttermilk,","Preheat the oven:
Preheat the oven to 425°F.

Whisk together the dry ingredients:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk 4 cups of the flour together with the sugar, salt, and baking soda.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Work in the butter and add the currants:
Using your (clean) fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Then add in the currants or raisins.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Add the egg and buttermilk:
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add the beaten egg and buttermilk to the well and mix in with a wooden spoon until the dough is too stiff to stir.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Form the dough:
Use floured hands to gently gather the dough into a rough ball shape. The dough will be soft and sticky. If it is more like a batter than a dough, add up to 1/2 cup more flour until you have a sticky, shaggy dough.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and shape into into a round loaf. Note that the dough will be a little sticky, and quite shaggy (a little like a shortcake biscuit dough).
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
You want to work it just enough so the flour is just moistened and the dough just barely comes together. Shaggy is good. If you over-work the dough the bread will end up tough.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Score with an X:
Transfer the dough to a large, lightly greased cast-iron skillet or a baking sheet (It will flatten out a bit in the pan or on the baking sheet).
Using a serrated knife, score the top of dough about an inch and a half deep in an ""X"" shape. The purpose of the scoring is to help heat get into the center of the dough while it cooks.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Bake until golden:
Transfer to the oven and bake at 425°F until the bread is golden and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped, about 35 to 45 minutes. (If you use a cast iron pan, it may take a little longer as it takes longer for the pan to heat up than a baking sheet.)
Check for doneness also by inserting a long, thin skewer into the center. If it comes out clean, it's done.
Hint 1: If the top is getting too dark while baking, tent the bread with some aluminum foil.
Hint 2: If you use a cast iron skillet to cook the bread in the oven, be very careful when you take the pan out. It's easy to forget that the handle is extremely hot. Be sure to put a pot holder over it.
Cool, slice, and serve:
Remove the pan or sheet from the oven, and let the bread sit in the pan or on the sheet for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, remove to a rack to cool briefly.
Serve the bread warm, at room temperature, or sliced and toasted. Best when eaten warm and just baked.

Preheat the oven to 475°F. Place a little flour in a shallow dish and keep it next to your dough.
Cut in the shortening:
Put the remaining flour in a large bowl. Add the shortening and cut it into the flour with a pastry cutter or two forks until the shortening is the size of small peas and covered in flour.
Alison Bickle
Make the dough:
Slowly pour the buttermilk around the bowl in circles, fluffing the flour with a fork as you go. Continue to stir with a fork until the flour is moistened and the dough looks shaggy. You will have some loose flour. That’s fine. Overworking the dough leads to dense biscuits.
Alison Bickle
Alison Bickle
Knead the dough:
Dump the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently about 5 or 6 times. It will just come together. Use your hands to shape it into a 7-inch round that is about an inch thick.
Alison Bickle
Alison Bickle
Alison Bickle
Cut the biscuits:
Dip a 3-inch biscuit cutter in the shallow dish with flour. Then, cut out the biscuits. Push straight down and lift up. Don’t twist. It can pinch the sides together and inhibit the rise.
Gather the remaining dough pieces to form the last biscuit or two by hand. Resist the temptation to knead and roll out the dough again.
Alison Bickle
Bake the biscuits:
Place the biscuits on a baking sheet so they are touching each other. Bake for 12 minutes until the biscuits have risen, spread a little, look bumpy on the surface, and are lightly golden in color.

Butter the biscuits:
Remove from the oven, and brush the tops with melted butter, while they are still hot.
Remove the biscuits from the pan and place on a baking rack to cool. Or eat them immediately, because hot biscuits are tasty and delicious!

At this point you can either gently fold in the blueberries, or wait until you pour the batter onto the griddle, and then place the blueberries into the surface of the pancake batter. Placing the blueberries into the pancakes while they are cooking will help keep them from bleeding.
Ladle batter in hot pan:
Heat a griddle or large pan on medium to medium high heat. (A large cast iron pan works great for cooking pancakes.)
Oil the pan with either a little butter or vegetable oil.
Ladle the pancake batter onto the griddle to the desired size (a quarter-cup measure works well for this), anywhere from 4 to 6 inches wide.
If you haven't already added the blueberries to the batter, you can place several in each pancake while it cooks.

When you see air bubbles in the center, flip the pancakes over:
When air bubbles start to bubble up to the surface at the center of the pancakes (about 2-3 minutes), use a flat metal spatula to flip them over.
After a minute, peek under one for doneness. When golden or darker golden brown, they are done.
Note that cooking the second side takes only about half as long as the first side. And the second side doesn't brown as evenly as the first side.
Continue to make the batches of pancakes, putting a little oil or butter on the pan before each batch so the pancakes don't stick.

Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.
Put a wire rack over a shallow baking pan and pour 1 cup of water into the pan. Season the ribs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the ribs on rack, meaty side up. Slide them into the oven and roast slowly. Check every hour or so for doneness. Roast until you can gently tear the meat between the bones, or they reach an internal temperature of 180 degrees F, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely.
When ribs are cooled, cut into individual ribs.
Pulse RITZ Crackers into crumbs in a food processor to make about 2 cups crumbs. Mix crumbs with granulated garlic, kosher salt and coarse black pepper.
Coat each rib in flour, dip in egg wash, and then coat with RITZ crumb mixture. Set aside.
Heat oil in deep 9-inch skillet to 350 degrees F. Place ribs meat side down into hot oil (ribs should be about 3/4 covered). Fry in batches, being careful not to overcrowd pan as this will bring down the oil temperature.
Cook approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until ribs are crispy and golden brown. Remove ribs from pan; drain on paper towels.
While ribs are still hot, season with 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning. Serve with Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.
To make the Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing, whisk together mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, garlic, chives, grated cheese, and Cajun seasoning in a bowl. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate until needed.
Tips
If the ribs are very meaty, they may take longer to cook. To prevent ribs from drying out, cover with foil during the last 1/2 hour of roasting.
We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.","897

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll out pie dough large enough to fit pie dish with just a bit of overhang. Transfer dough to pie dish and gently fit into dish. Trim excess dough hanging over the edge. Fold about 1/2 inch of the edge of the dough to the inside edge of the pie crust to reinforce it. Crimp the edge. Prick the bottom and sides of the crust with a fork about 10 times. Place a sheet of parchment paper gently into the crust and fill with pie weights or dried beans so pie crust doesn't bubble up with you bake it.
Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven; lift weights from pan with edges of parchment paper. Allow crust to cool completely.
Place butter in mixing bowl; add sugar. Stir together until completely combined using a spatula, 4 or 5 minutes. Add flour and salt. Mix together until combined. Stir in 3 eggs; mix until slightly blended. Then using a whisk, whisk together until mixture is fairly smooth and creamy.
Pour in vanilla extract. Add nutmeg, zest of lemon, lemon juice, and buttermilk. Whisk until thoroughly mixed, 2 or 3 minutes. Pour into the pie shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and just set, 45 to 55 minutes. Pie should have a slight wiggle, but not a soupy jiggle. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until chilled, 1 to 2 hours.
Chef's Notes:
You can use 1/2 of my Buttercrust Pastry Dough for this recipe — it would be perfect!
I've never had much trouble finding buttermilk, even in regular, non-fancy grocery stores, but depending on where you live in the world, apparently that may not the case. There are many hacks for making a substitute, usually using milk and lemon juice, or vinegar. I'll let you Google those at your leisure, but I'd be more inclined to try some yogurt, thinned out with some milk to be closer to the tanginess of buttermilk.
Once your pie is made, it can be served as-is, or topped with seasonal fruit. I went with raspberries, mostly for the pictures, but if you were going to do this for the holidays, some persimmons, and/or pomegranate seeds would also be very nice.","415

Heat oil in deep 9-inch skillet to 350 degrees F. Place ribs meat side down into hot oil (ribs should be about 3/4 covered). Fry in batches, being careful not to overcrowd pan as this will bring down the oil temperature.
Cook approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until ribs are crispy and golden brown. Remove ribs from pan; drain on paper towels.
While ribs are still hot, season with 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning. Serve with Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.
To make the Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing, whisk together mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, garlic, chives, grated cheese, and Cajun seasoning in a bowl. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate until needed.
Tips
If the ribs are very meaty, they may take longer to cook. To prevent ribs from drying out, cover with foil during the last 1/2 hour of roasting.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll out pie dough large enough to fit pie dish with just a bit of overhang. Transfer dough to pie dish and gently fit into dish. Trim excess dough hanging over the edge.

Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven; lift weights from pan with edges of parchment paper. Allow crust to cool completely.

Pour in vanilla extract. Add nutmeg, zest of lemon, lemon juice, and buttermilk. Whisk until thoroughly mixed, 2 or 3 minutes. Pour into the pie shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and just set, 45 to 55 minutes. Pie should have a slight wiggle, but not a soupy jiggle. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until chilled, 1 to 2 hours.
Chef's Notes:
You can use 1/2 of my Buttercrust Pastry Dough for this recipe — it would be perfect!
I've never had much trouble finding buttermilk, even in regular, non-fancy grocery stores, but depending on where you live in the world, apparently that may not the case. There are many hacks for making a substitute, usually using milk and lemon juice, or vinegar. I'll let you Google those at your leisure, but I'd be more inclined to try some yogurt, thinned out with some milk to be closer to the tanginess of buttermilk.
Once your pie is made, it can be served as-is, or topped with seasonal fruit. I went with raspberries, mostly for the pictures, but if you were going to do this for the holidays, some persimmons, and/or pomegranate seeds would also be very nice.","415

Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.
Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits. Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.

Cook's Note:
The oil is 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to start, but it may drop to about 300 degrees (150 degrees C) when chicken is added. It should rise back to 305 to 310 degrees F (155 degrees C) and be held at that temperature until done, about 25 minutes.
Editor's Note:
The nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of buttermilk. The actual amount of buttermilk consumed will vary.
We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.","1262

423,"RITZ Country Fried Ribs with Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing, created by Dinosaur Bar-B-Que","These ribs are a new spin on a Dinosaur classic--coated in RITZ cracker crumbs then pan fried until crispy. For added flavor and a little kick, we've paired them with a Zesty Buttermilk Ranch dressing. At Dinosaur Bar-B-Que we're known for our delicious ribs, and this recipe is just that: delicious and perfect for parties.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235562/ritz-country-fried-ribs-with-zesty-buttermilk-ranch-dressing-created-by-dinosaur-bar-b-que/,"3 racks St. Louis style ribs,2 sleeves RITZ Crackers,1 teaspoon granulated garlic,1 teaspoon kosher salt,1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper,6 eggs, beaten,1 cup all-purpose flour for dredging,4 cups vegetable oil for frying,2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, for ribs,1 ¼ cups mayonnaise,1 cup buttermilk,2 tablespoons red wine vinegar,2 teaspoons minced garlic,¼ cup finely chopped chives,¼ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese,2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning,","Directions
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.
Put a wire rack over a shallow baking pan and pour 1 cup of water into the pan. Season the ribs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the ribs on rack, meaty side up. Slide them into the oven and roast slowly. Check every hour or so for doneness. Roast until you can gently tear the meat between the bones, or they reach an internal temperature of 180 degrees F, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely.
When ribs are cooled, cut into individual ribs.
Pulse RITZ Crackers into crumbs in a food processor to make about 2 cups crumbs. Mix crumbs with granulated garlic, kosher salt and coarse black pepper.
Coat each rib in flour, dip in egg wash, and then coat with RITZ crumb mixture. Set aside.
Heat oil in deep 9-inch skillet to 350 degrees F. Place ribs meat side down into hot oil (ribs should be about 3/4 covered). Fry in batches, being careful not to overcrowd pan as this will bring down the oil temperature.
Cook approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until ribs are crispy and golden brown. Remove ribs from pan; drain on paper towels.
While ribs are still hot, season with 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning. Serve with Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.
To make the Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing, whisk together mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, garlic, chives, grated cheese, and Cajun seasoning in a bowl. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate until needed.
Tips
If the ribs are very meaty, they may take longer to cook. To prevent ribs from drying out, cover with foil during the last 1/2 hour of roasting.

Chef's Notes:
You can use 1/2 of my Buttercrust Pastry Dough for this recipe — it would be perfect!
I've never had much trouble finding buttermilk, even in regular, non-fancy grocery stores, but depending on where you live in the world, apparently that may not the case. There are many hacks for making a substitute, usually using milk and lemon juice, or vinegar. I'll let you Google those at your leisure, but I'd be more inclined to try some yogurt, thinned out with some milk to be closer to the tanginess of buttermilk.
Once your pie is made, it can be served as-is, or topped with seasonal fruit. I went with raspberries, mostly for the pictures, but if you were going to do this for the holidays, some persimmons, and/or pomegranate seeds would also be very nice.","415

443,Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuits,"This deceptively simple buttermilk biscuit recipe can come out a million different ways with some very minor variations on the ingredients and amounts. This one's my favorite — flaky, but not dry; chewy, but not tough; and crisp in just the right spots. Ice-cold butter and some extra dough folding are key to having lots of flaky layers in each golden brown buttermilk biscuit.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220943/chef-johns-buttermilk-biscuits/,"2 cups all-purpose flour,2 teaspoons baking powder,¼ teaspoon baking soda,1 teaspoon salt,7 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled in freezer and cut into thin slices,¾ cup cold buttermilk,2 tablespoons buttermilk for brushing,","Directions
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add cold butter slices and cut into the flour with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour cold buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just combined.
Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together into a rectangle.
Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.
Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits. Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.
Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet. Press an indent into the top of each biscuit with your thumb. Brush buttermilk over the tops.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are flaky and golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Cook's Note:
The oil is 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to start, but it may drop to about 300 degrees (150 degrees C) when chicken is added. It should rise back to 305 to 310 degrees F (155 degrees C) and be held at that temperature until done, about 25 minutes.

For added flavor and a little kick, we've paired them with a Zesty Buttermilk Ranch dressing. At Dinosaur Bar-B-Que we're known for our delicious ribs, and this recipe is just that: delicious and perfect for parties.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235562/ritz-country-fried-ribs-with-zesty-buttermilk-ranch-dressing-created-by-dinosaur-bar-b-que/,"3 racks St. Louis style ribs,2 sleeves RITZ Crackers,1 teaspoon granulated garlic,1 teaspoon kosher salt,1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper,6 eggs, beaten,1 cup all-purpose flour for dredging,4 cups vegetable oil for frying,2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, for ribs,1 ¼ cups mayonnaise,1 cup buttermilk,2 tablespoons red wine vinegar,2 teaspoons minced garlic,¼ cup finely chopped chives,¼ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese,2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning,","Directions
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.
Put a wire rack over a shallow baking pan and pour 1 cup of water into the pan. Season the ribs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the ribs on rack, meaty side up. Slide them into the oven and roast slowly. Check every hour or so for doneness. Roast until you can gently tear the meat between the bones, or they reach an internal temperature of 180 degrees F, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely.
When ribs are cooled, cut into individual ribs.
Pulse RITZ Crackers into crumbs in a food processor to make about 2 cups crumbs. Mix crumbs with granulated garlic, kosher salt and coarse black pepper.
Coat each rib in flour, dip in egg wash, and then coat with RITZ crumb mixture. Set aside.
Heat oil in deep 9-inch skillet to 350 degrees F. Place ribs meat side down into hot oil (ribs should be about 3/4 covered). Fry in batches, being careful not to overcrowd pan as this will bring down the oil temperature.
Cook approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until ribs are crispy and golden brown. Remove ribs from pan; drain on paper towels.
While ribs are still hot, season with 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning. Serve with Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.
To make the Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing, whisk together mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, garlic, chives, grated cheese, and Cajun seasoning in a bowl. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate until needed.
Tips
If the ribs are very meaty, they may take longer to cook. To prevent ribs from drying out, cover with foil during the last 1/2 hour of roasting.

Chef's Notes:
You can use 1/2 of my Buttercrust Pastry Dough for this recipe — it would be perfect!
I've never had much trouble finding buttermilk, even in regular, non-fancy grocery stores, but depending on where you live in the world, apparently that may not the case. There are many hacks for making a substitute, usually using milk and lemon juice, or vinegar. I'll let you Google those at your leisure, but I'd be more inclined to try some yogurt, thinned out with some milk to be closer to the tanginess of buttermilk.
Once your pie is made, it can be served as-is, or topped with seasonal fruit. I went with raspberries, mostly for the pictures, but if you were going to do this for the holidays, some persimmons, and/or pomegranate seeds would also be very nice.","415

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add cold butter slices and cut into the flour with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour cold buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just combined.
Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together into a rectangle.
Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.
Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits. Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.
Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet. Press an indent into the top of each biscuit with your thumb. Brush buttermilk over the tops.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are flaky and golden brown, about 15 minutes.

The oil is 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to start, but it may drop to about 300 degrees (150 degrees C) when chicken is added. It should rise back to 305 to 310 degrees F (155 degrees C) and be held at that temperature until done, about 25 minutes.

At Dinosaur Bar-B-Que we're known for our delicious ribs, and this recipe is just that: delicious and perfect for parties.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235562/ritz-country-fried-ribs-with-zesty-buttermilk-ranch-dressing-created-by-dinosaur-bar-b-que/,"3 racks St. Louis style ribs,2 sleeves RITZ Crackers,1 teaspoon granulated garlic,1 teaspoon kosher salt,1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper,6 eggs, beaten,1 cup all-purpose flour for dredging,4 cups vegetable oil for frying,2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, for ribs,1 ¼ cups mayonnaise,1 cup buttermilk,2 tablespoons red wine vinegar,2 teaspoons minced garlic,¼ cup finely chopped chives,¼ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese,2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning,","Directions
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.
Put a wire rack over a shallow baking pan and pour 1 cup of water into the pan. Season the ribs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the ribs on rack, meaty side up. Slide them into the oven and roast slowly. Check every hour or so for doneness. Roast until you can gently tear the meat between the bones, or they reach an internal temperature of 180 degrees F, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely.
When ribs are cooled, cut into individual ribs.
Pulse RITZ Crackers into crumbs in a food processor to make about 2 cups crumbs. Mix crumbs with granulated garlic, kosher salt and coarse black pepper.
Coat each rib in flour, dip in egg wash, and then coat with RITZ crumb mixture. Set aside.
Heat oil in deep 9-inch skillet to 350 degrees F. Place ribs meat side down into hot oil (ribs should be about 3/4 covered). Fry in batches, being careful not to overcrowd pan as this will bring down the oil temperature.
Cook approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until ribs are crispy and golden brown. Remove ribs from pan; drain on paper towels.
While ribs are still hot, season with 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning. Serve with Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.
To make the Zesty Buttermilk Ranch Dressing, whisk together mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, garlic, chives, grated cheese, and Cajun seasoning in a bowl. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate until needed.
Tips
If the ribs are very meaty, they may take longer to cook. To prevent ribs from drying out, cover with foil during the last 1/2 hour of roasting.

Chef's Notes:
You can use 1/2 of my Buttercrust Pastry Dough for this recipe — it would be perfect!
I've never had much trouble finding buttermilk, even in regular, non-fancy grocery stores, but depending on where you live in the world, apparently that may not the case. There are many hacks for making a substitute, usually using milk and lemon juice, or vinegar. I'll let you Google those at your leisure, but I'd be more inclined to try some yogurt, thinned out with some milk to be closer to the tanginess of buttermilk.
Once your pie is made, it can be served as-is, or topped with seasonal fruit. I went with raspberries, mostly for the pictures, but if you were going to do this for the holidays, some persimmons, and/or pomegranate seeds would also be very nice.","415

Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour cold buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just combined.
Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together into a rectangle.
Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.
Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits. Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.
Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet. Press an indent into the top of each biscuit with your thumb. Brush buttermilk over the tops.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all the dough ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed.

Cover and let it rise for 1-2 hours at room temperature. Use it right away, or transfer to the fridge overnight.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Press out the dough:
Film a half-sheet pan or baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil and pat the dough out so that it fills the entire pan. If it springs back, wait a few minutes and then continue patting it out. Let the dough rise uncovered until puffy—about 1/2 hour for room temperature dough, or an hour for refrigerated dough.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Caramelize the onions:
Meanwhile, warm 2 teaspoons of butter or olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions with 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep brown. This will take 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and remove from heat. Let the onions cool slightly.
Simply Recipes / Sally Vargas
Preheat the oven:

Preheat the oven to 425°F.
Top the focaccia:
Uncover the dough and brush the top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil, paying special attention to the edges and corners. Gently dimple the top of the focaccia all over by pressing your fingertips about halfway down into the dough.
Scatter the onions over top. Dot the cubes of brie evenly over the onions, followed by the cranberries. Finish by sprinkling the rosemary over top along with as much black pepper as you like.

Bake:
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the bottom of the crust is golden (lift it up with a spatula to check). If the toppings start to brown too much before the bottom of the crust is golden, cover the pan loosely with foil.

Add the eggs one at a time, stirring after each addition until the eggs are incorporated into the dough. (Do this part in a mixer if you want, or by hand with a wooden spoon.) The dough should become rather creamy.

547,Deep-Dish Bacon and Cheddar Quiche,"Grace your holiday table, Easter brunch, or Sunday supper with this show-stopping Deep-Dish Quiche. It’s as beautiful as it is delicious. Make it ahead, freeze, and reheat when needed. What is better than that?",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/deep_dish_bacon_and_cheddar_quiche/,,"For the dough:
Start the dough:
In a large bowl, whisk the flour and salt until blended.
Add the butter cubes to the flour and toss to separate and coat them. Between your thumb and index finger, squish and flatten each cube, and toss in the flour as you flatten them.
Sally Vargas
Sally Vargas
Add the water and mix the dough:
Drizzle 10 tablespoons of the ice water over the flour and butter and toss together like you toss a salad. Continue to mix with your hands until the dough clumps together. If the dough seems very floury and doesn’t clump together, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
Form the dough into a disc:
Tip the clumps onto the countertop gather them together with your hands, pressing and kneading briefly until the clumps come together to form a dough. Shape it into a round, flat disc that is about 7 inches in diameter. Wrap in plastic and chill for 10 minutes in the refrigerator, or for up to 3 days. You can proceed to roll the dough after 10 minutes, or when it is convenient.
Sally Vargas
Sally Vargas
Roll the dough:
If you’ve refrigerated the dough for more than 30 minutes, remove it from the refrigerator to soften slightly before rolling.
On a generously floured surface roll the dough with a floured rolling pin into a 14- or 15-inch circle that is about 1/8-inch thick. Keep lifting the dough as you roll it to make sure it isn’t sticking to the work surface. If it starts to stick, sprinkle some flour underneath it.
Line the pan:
Roll the dough over the rolling pin to lift and drape it over and into the springform pan. Lift the edges as you press the dough into the bottom edge of the pan and up the sides; try to avoid stretching it. Once the dough is securely in the pan, roll the rolling pin over the top edge to “cut” away the excess. If you like, make a pattern with the tines of a fork all around the edge.
Sally Vargas
Sally Vargas
Sally Vargas
Sally Vargas
Chill the dough:
Cover the dough with plastic and chill in the freezer for 30 minutes.
Blind bake the crust:
Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F. Line the dough with aluminum foil and fill the pan to the brim with pie weights, dried beans, or rice. Set the pan on a baking sheet and bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until the crust is golden brown. Let the crust rest for 5 minutes then remove the foil and pie weights.
While the crust bakes cook the bacon and make the filling.
Sally Vargas
Sally Vargas
Cook the bacon:
In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon for 5 to 6 minutes, or until lightly browned but not quite crisp. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Make the filling:
In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until they are fully combined and homogenous. Whisk in the cream, salt, pepper, and parsley.
Sally Vargas
Sally Vargas
Assemble the quiche:
Spread 1 cup of the grated cheese over the bottom of the crust and sprinkle the bacon on top. Sprinkle with the scallions. Pour the filling over the ingredients and leave about 1/8-inch headspace. Do not overfill—you need to have room for the quiche to expand as it cooks. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup cheese on top.
Alternatively: If you’re concerned about spilling the quiche, fill it halfway with the filling, pull the oven rack out partly, transfer the quiche to the oven, fill it the rest of the way and top it with cheese.
Sally Vargas

Sally Vargas
Sally Vargas
Bake the quiche:
Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Check to see if the cheese on top has browned, and if so, cover loosely with foil.
Continue baking for 25 to 30 additional minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is still a little wobbly. Total baking time is 70 to 75 minutes.
The quiche is done when a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean. Remove from rack to cool for at least 2 hours before slicing.

Use your clean hands to squish the flour and butter together, breaking up the butter into smaller pieces until the mixture resembles a rather shaggy coarse meal with a few pea-sized pieces of butter. Add the sour cream and a couple tablespoons of finely grated sharp cheddar cheese and stir with a fork until incorporated.

Prepare the galette
Peel, core, quarter the apples, place in water with lemon juice:
Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Prepare a large bowl half filled with water. Squeeze into it the juice of half a lemon (and put the squeezed lemon in too if you want). Peel, quarter, and core the apples, and place into the acidulated water while you work to keep the apples from discoloring.
Elise Bauer
Slice the apple quarters:
Remove the apple quarters from the water. Slice each apple quarter into 4 or 5 slices, lengthwise, about 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch thick at the widest end. Return the apple slices to the acidulated water.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Drain apple slices, sprinkle with maple syrup, cinnamon, minute tapioca, zest:
Drain the apple slices. Place the apple slices back in the now empty bowl. Sprinkle with maple syrup and cinnamon and gently toss so that the apple slices are lightly coated with both. Add the minute tapioca and the lemon zest. Gently toss again.
Roll out the dough, transfer to lined baking sheet:
On a clean, lightly floured, flat surface, place the disk of dough. Roll out with a rolling pin to an even thickness and about 14 inches wide. Gently move the rolled out pastry dough to a parchment lined baking sheet.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Arrange apple slices on the dough:
Starting from 2 inches from the perimeter of the pastry round, arrange the apple slices, side by side, in a circular pattern, filling the circle. It's okay if some of the apple slices overlap a little.
Sprinkle with cheese, fold edges over in pleats:
Sprinkle the top of the apples with grated cheddar cheese. Gently fold the dough up over the apple slices, forming pleats with the dough every few inches.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with coarse sugar:
Place an egg in a small bowl with a teaspoon of water, beat with a fork or whisk until smooth. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the exposed border of the dough (don't put on the apples, just the dough). Sprinkle the egg washed crust with coarse sugar.
Elise Bauer
Bake:
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes (until beginning to brown) at 400°F (205°C). Then lower the temperature to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, until the apples are cooked through and the crust is nicely browned.

Scrub the potatoes clean then bake the potatoes using your favorite method, either oven or microwave. If using an oven, pierce a few times with a sharp knife or the tines of a fork, rub with olive oil and bake in a 400°F oven for about an hour until the potatoes are cooked through and give a little when pressed.
If using a microwave, pierce the potato a few times with a sharp knife of the tines of a fork, rub all over with olive oil and cook on the high setting for about 5 minutes per potato.
I have found that baking the potatoes in a conventional oven yields potatoes that are easier to work with (cut and scoop out), the potato seems to adhere to the skins a little better, but there is hardly a discernible difference in the final product.

Cut the potatoes in half and scoop out the insides:
Remove the potatoes from the oven and let cool enough to handle. Cut in half horizontally. Use a spoon to carefully scoop out the insides, reserving the scooped potatoes for another use, leaving about 1/4 of an inch of potato on the skin.

Bake the potato skins:
Increase the heat of the oven to 450°F. Brush or rub olive oil all over the potato skins, outside and in. Sprinkle with salt.
Place on a baking rack in a roasting pan (don't use a cookie sheet, it will warp, use a roasting pan or broiler pan that can take the heat).
Cook for 10 minutes on one side, then flip the skins over and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool enough to handle.

Don’t forget the cheese and oyster crackers!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/cincinnati_chili/,"2 pounds ground beef (80:20 is good),1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste,4 cups water,1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce,1 large onion, minced (about 3 cups),6 cloves garlic, minced,3 tablespoons chili powder,1 teaspoon ground cumin,1 teaspoon cinnamon,3/4 teaspoon ground allspice,1/4 teaspoon ground cloves,1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper,2 teaspoons kosher salt,2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce,1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar,1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate, optional,Oyster crackers,Finely shredded mild cheddar cheese,1 (15.5-ounce) can small red kidney beans, drained and warmed,Minced yellow onion,Hot cooked spaghetti,","Cook the tomato paste:
Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the tomato paste to the dry pot and cook, constantly scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, until the tomato smells rich and toasty and you start to see browned (not burned) patches in the bottom of the pot. This should take 1 to 3 minutes.
Combine the ingredients in a pot:
Remove the pot from heat and add the ground beef and water. Mix them together into a sludge. It will not look pretty, but press on. There's a method to this madness.
Return to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer, stirring all the while, so the sludge breaks up into a mealy paste. Add all the remaining ingredients except the vinegar and chocolate.

Simmer gently, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours:
Stir the chili often. You want the volume to reduce a bit. (To be honest, just one hour of cook time is okay, but for optimal chili-ness, go long.)
Right at the end of your cooking time, add the vinegar and optional chocolate.
Simple Tip!
The chocolate won’t make it taste sweet—it adds a hint of sophisticated complexity and acts as a foil for all those spices. Chili parlors in Cincinnati don't use chocolate in their recipes; it's a highly contested addition, but I stand behind it.
Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate overnight:
Cool the chili to room temperature, then cover the pot and refrigerate overnight.
Simple Tip!
You can eat the chili immediately if you want to, but the flavor improves as it rests.
De-fat the chili:
The next day, lift or scrape off any solidified fat from the top of the chili and discard.
Alison Conklin
Alison Conklin
Simple Tip!
Leave a little fat in the chili, if you like.
Warm and serve:
Bring to a rapid simmer over medium heat, stirring often. Serve in a bowl, over a hot dog, or on a plate in any of the ""ways"" below.
2-Way: Over spaghetti.
3-Way: Over spaghetti with finely shredded cheddar cheese.
4-Way: Over spaghetti with diced onions and finely shredded cheddar cheese.
5-Way: Over spaghetti with warmed canned red kidney beans, diced onions, and finely shredded cheddar cheese.
The chili will also keep refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 year.

Whisk dry ingredients, add cheese and jalapeños:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, polenta, salt, sugar, cayenne, and baking powder.
Stir in 1 1/4 cups of the grated cheddar cheese and the diced jalapeños.
Elise Bauer
Add the cream:
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the cream into the center of the well and your (clean) hands to gently bring together the ingredients.
If you need to add a bit more cream then do so a tiny trickle at a time. You just want everything to get wet enough so that the dough will be sticky and clumpy.
Elise Bauer
Knead the dough, just enough:
Turn the dough out onto a surface lightly dusted with flour. Knead the dough just a few times - maybe only three or four pushes. You just want it to just come together. (Over-kneading will result in firmer, denser biscuits.)
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Cut out biscuit shapes:
Form the dough into a disc about 3/4-inch to an inch thick. Use a biscuit cutter (or a small juice glass) to cut round biscuit shapes out of the disk. Combine the leftover dough and keep forming small round biscuit shapes until the dough is used up.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Brush with cream, sprinkle with cheese:
Place on a silicone-lined or parchment lined baking sheet, with at least an inch or two between the biscuits. Brush the tops of the biscuits with a little more cream. Top the biscuits with a sprinkle of the remaining cheese.

Bake:
Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 11-12 minutes or until golden and the cheese is nicely melted.;","187

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar in a 9-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to caramelize, 5 to 10 minutes. When mixture starts to simmer, add diced apples and sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Gently press on the apples with a spatula until coated with sugar mixture and simmer, without stirring, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
Combine baking mix, milk, shredded Cheddar cheese, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl and stir until consistency is similar to a waffle batter. Spoon mixture evenly over the apples in the skillet; no need to be too precise as it will spread out while baking.
Bake skillet in preheated oven until batter reaches a firm consistency and is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the stovetop until the caramelized sugar thickens a bit, about 5 minutes. Spoon servings onto individual plates, drizzle with caramel liquid, and serve while warm.
Cook's Notes:
You can use Golden Delicious apples in place of Granny Smiths, but do not use Red Delicious or other soft apples as they will disintegrate when cooked.
You can use margarine instead of butter, buttermilk instead of milk, and sharp yellow Cheddar instead of white Cheddar.","498

Add spinach, condensed soup, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and pepper to the onions; stir to combine. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole. Sprinkle bread crumbs evenly over top and dot with remaining butter.

Cook's Notes:
You can use broccoli instead of spinach.
I make this the day before and refrigerated overnight, adding bread crumbs and butter just before baking.
I don't normally use garlic salt or seasoned salt because I think the other ingredients have enough salt in them for us.","340

You can use Golden Delicious apples in place of Granny Smiths, but do not use Red Delicious or other soft apples as they will disintegrate when cooked.

Combine butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar in a 9-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to caramelize, 5 to 10 minutes. When mixture starts to simmer, add diced apples and sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Gently press on the apples with a spatula until coated with sugar mixture and simmer, without stirring, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
Combine baking mix, milk, shredded Cheddar cheese, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl and stir until consistency is similar to a waffle batter. Spoon mixture evenly over the apples in the skillet; no need to be too precise as it will spread out while baking.
Bake skillet in preheated oven until batter reaches a firm consistency and is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the stovetop until the caramelized sugar thickens a bit, about 5 minutes. Spoon servings onto individual plates, drizzle with caramel liquid, and serve while warm.
Cook's Notes:
You can use Golden Delicious apples in place of Granny Smiths, but do not use Red Delicious or other soft apples as they will disintegrate when cooked.
You can use margarine instead of butter, buttermilk instead of milk, and sharp yellow Cheddar instead of white Cheddar.","498

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar in a 9-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to caramelize, 5 to 10 minutes. When mixture starts to simmer, add diced apples and sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Gently press on the apples with a spatula until coated with sugar mixture and simmer, without stirring, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
Combine baking mix, milk, shredded Cheddar cheese, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl and stir until consistency is similar to a waffle batter. Spoon mixture evenly over the apples in the skillet; no need to be too precise as it will spread out while baking.
Bake skillet in preheated oven until batter reaches a firm consistency and is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the stovetop until the caramelized sugar thickens a bit, about 5 minutes. Spoon servings onto individual plates, drizzle with caramel liquid, and serve while warm.
Cook's Notes:
You can use Golden Delicious apples in place of Granny Smiths, but do not use Red Delicious or other soft apples as they will disintegrate when cooked.
You can use margarine instead of butter, buttermilk instead of milk, and sharp yellow Cheddar instead of white Cheddar.","498

Cube and toast the bread:
Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes. Spread the cubes evenly onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, and toast in the oven until just golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.
Sarah Fritsche
Cook the vegetables:
Set a large cast iron or oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil. Once it shimmers, add the onions and cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes.
Add the mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook until tender and most of their liquid has been released, about 7 minutes. Add the Brussels sprouts, and another 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook until just tender and the pan is mostly dry, another 7 minutes.
Stir in the garlic, thyme, and crushed red chile flakes; cook until aromatic, another 30 seconds.
Sarah Fritsche
Add the bread:
Add the toasted bread cubes to the skillet and toss until combined with the mushrooms and Brussels sprouts. Remove from heat and set aside.
Make the custard:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper.
Sarah Fritsche
Finish the strata:
Pour the custard over the top of the bread mixture and let sit for at least 30 minutes so the bread cubes can soak up the custard. Stir the mixture occasionally to make sure custard is distributed evenly. Dot the top of the strata with the crumbled goat cheese.
Sarah Fritsche
Bake the strata:
Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the strata until puffed, golden brown, and set in the center, about 45 minutes.

You can use butter instead of margarine. If gluten isn't an issue, you can use graham crackers instead of gingersnaps.

Melt chocolate in a double boiler (you can use a makeshift double boiler by placing a metal bowl over a small saucepan of boiling water, just don’t let the bottom of the bowl touch the water).
Alison Bickel
Add the boiling water, cocoa powder, and half of the sugar:
When the chocolate has melted, transfer to a medium-sized, heavy-bottomed saucepan, turn heat to medium low, and add the boiling water, cocoa powder and half of the sugar. Whisk vigorously until there are no lumps. Remove from heat.
Alison Bickel
Finish making the chocolate mixture:
Add the milk, 1 cup of the cream, remaining sugar, instant coffee (if using), and the salt to the chocolate base, and whisk vigorously until fully incorporated, then use a rubber spatula to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan.
When the chocolate base is smooth, set the pot over medium high heat and warm, stirring occasionally, until the base starts to steam.
Temper the egg yolks:
Whisk the egg yolks in a medium sized bowl. Once the chocolate base has heated to point of being steamy, temper the eggs by slowly pouring some of the hot base into the eggs while whisking the eggs vigorously to prevent them from cooking.
Once you've incorporated about half of the base with the eggs, pour the egg mixture back into the pan with the rest of the chocolate base and stir to combine.
Heat the base until it starts to thicken, remove from heat, and add the chilled cream:
Lower the heat to medium, and heat the base until it reaches 170°F. At this point the base will have thickened slightly and will just be getting steamy again. Remove from heat.
Stir in the remaining cup of cold cream to prevent further cooking.
Strain, place the bowl in an ice water bath, and stir in the vanilla:
Pour the chocolate base through a mesh strainer into a bowl to strain out any solids or curds, and place bowl in an ice bath to speed up the chilling. Stir in the vanilla.
Alison Bickel
Alison Bickel
Chill the base completely:
Chill ice cream base for several hours, preferably overnight, until completely chilled. (To speed up this process you can put the ice cream base, still in its bowl in the ice bath, in the freezer for an hour, stirring every 20 minutes.)
Process in ice cream maker:
Churn in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s directions. If you like soft ice cream, eat immediately. Otherwise, transfer it to a freezer container and put it in the freezer for a couple hours to firm up.
Note that the ice cream may be quite hard when you first take it out of the freezer, so you may want to let it sit for a few minutes to soften before trying to scoop.

With the mixture still on low, add the egg mixture, 1/3 at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.
Pour the cooled, melted chocolate into the bowl of the stand mixer and (you guessed it!) beat on low for about a minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Beat on low again for about 30 seconds, or until the chocolate is fully incorporated. Alternatively, you can fold in the chocolate in using a spatula.

Prepare the water bath and add the filling:
Wrap the outside of the your springform pan in 3 layers of aluminum foil. Be careful not to tear or puncture the foil. Bring the foil all the way up the sides. Set it inside a roasting pan or a large Dutch oven.
Pour the filling into springform pan.
Fill the roasting pan with warm water about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. (I usually just heat it in a tea kettle.) Be careful not to splash any water into the cheesecake pan or inside the foil.

Bake the cheesecake:
Put the pan in the oven and bake until the cheesecake is just barely set in the center, 55-65 minutes. It will still jiggle slightly, but shouldn’t slosh in the center when moved.
Let it cool, then chill:
Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Let the cake cool in the water bath for about an hour. Then remove it from the water bath and transfer it to a cooling rack on the counter for another hour. Finally, keep the cake in the springform pan, and let it chill, uncovered overnight in the fridge.

Make the ganache:
Place chopped chocolate in a medium-sized bowl. In a small saucepan set over medium heat, add the heavy cream, corn syrup, and salt. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer.
Pour the heated cream over the chopped chocolate. Don’t stir. Let sit for 5 minutes, then add the vanilla. Use a spatula and stir gently to combine. Let the ganache cool at room temperature for 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge until you’re ready to serve the cheesecake.

Finish the cake:
The ganache is probably too thick to pour. Simply warm it in the microwave for 15-second intervals (or more depending on how powerful your microwave is) until it’s pourable. (Be careful, though – chocolate can burn quickly in a microwave.) Stir it gently.
Remove the cheesecake from the springform pan. Pour about half of the ganache over the top, just until it drips down a little on the sides. You probably won’t use all of the ganache. Save the rest to add to hot milk for the most luxurious hot cocoa or freeze it in scoopfuls for when you need a little chocolate fix.
