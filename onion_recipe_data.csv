0,Caramelized French Onion Dip,"My family loves French onion dip but I find most recipes made from fresh onions tend to be very sweet. By adding the beef bouillon and Worcestershire sauce, it deepens the flavors and slows the caramelization of the onions. The result is a savory dip that goes great with veggies, crackers, and chips. Enjoy!",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/285493/caramelized-french-onion-dip/,"2 tablespoons olive oil,3 cups diced yellow onions,1 clove garlic, minced,½ cup water, or more if needed,1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce,1 tablespoon beef base (such as Better than Bouillon®),1 teaspoon onion powder,½ teaspoon dried thyme,1 teaspoon white sugar,salt and ground black pepper to taste,1 pint sour cream,","Directions
Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup water, Worcestershire, beef base, onion powder, and thyme. Increase heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly until beef base is dissolved.
Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, 30 to 45 minutes. Liquid will slowly evaporate and onions will caramelize. If onions start to stick to the pan, throw in a splash of water and scrape up the delicious bits. Taste before adding sugar, salt, and pepper. Once seasoned to your liking, remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix cooled onions with sour cream until well combined. Chill for 1 hour before serving.
Cook's Note:
Sodium levels in bouillon vary greatly, so be sure to taste your onions before adding the salt. As with most dips, it tastes better the next day so if you can, make this a day ahead of time.","93

1,German Zwiebelkuchen (Onion Pie),"Zwiebelkuchen is an onion pie from Swabia, in south-central Germany. It is a special time of year, in the fall, when the mom & pop winemakers will open a BasinWirtschaft in their barn or garage. They serve the new wine, fresh zwiebelkuchen, and perhaps some wurst, for a minimal fee. A few tables are set up, and they are open when they have time to serve. To indicate they are serving, they will hang a straw broom over the doorway. The combination of the onions and the 'green' wine can have explosive consequences later on!",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24674/german-zwiebelkuchen-onion-pie/,"6 pounds onions, sliced,4 slices bacon,1 (16 ounce) container sour cream,4 egg,2 tablespoons all-purpose flour,½ teaspoon salt,½ teaspoon caraway seed,2 recipes pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie,","Directions

Make sauce: Mix mayonnaise, horseradish, ketchup, paprika, cayenne, salt, oregano, and black pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined. Cover and store in the refrigerator until needed.
Make coating: Beat milk and egg together in a medium bowl until well combined. Mix flour, salt, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, oregano, thyme, and cumin together in a separate bowl. Set both bowls aside.
Prepare onion: Slice 1 inch off of the top and bottom of onion and remove the papery skin. Remove a 1-inch diameter core from middle of onion, leaving the very bottom of the root end intact. Use a large, sharp knife to slice down center of onion about 3/4 of the way down; turn onion 90 degrees and slice again. Keep slicing each section in half until you have 16 sections, being careful not to cut through bottom of onion.
Spread ""petals"" apart. (To help keep them separate, you could plunge onion into boiling water for 1 minute and then into cold water to stop the cooking.)
Dip onion into milk mixture and then coat well with seasoned flour mixture, separating the petals and sprinkling the flour mixture between them. Dip onion back into milk mixture, then coat with flour mixture again to ensure all pieces are well coated.
Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries.
Lower onion, cut-side up, into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain on a rack or on paper towels.
Open center of onion wide enough to fit the bowl of dipping sauce and serve.

19,Caramelized French Onion Dip,"My family loves French onion dip but I find most recipes made from fresh onions tend to be very sweet.

Enjoy!",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/285493/caramelized-french-onion-dip/,"2 tablespoons olive oil,3 cups diced yellow onions,1 clove garlic, minced,½ cup water, or more if needed,1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce,1 tablespoon beef base (such as Better than Bouillon®),1 teaspoon onion powder,½ teaspoon dried thyme,1 teaspoon white sugar,salt and ground black pepper to taste,1 pint sour cream,","Directions
Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup water, Worcestershire, beef base, onion powder, and thyme. Increase heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly until beef base is dissolved.
Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, 30 to 45 minutes. Liquid will slowly evaporate and onions will caramelize. If onions start to stick to the pan, throw in a splash of water and scrape up the delicious bits. Taste before adding sugar, salt, and pepper. Once seasoned to your liking, remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix cooled onions with sour cream until well combined. Chill for 1 hour before serving.

Sodium levels in bouillon vary greatly, so be sure to taste your onions before adding the salt. As with most dips, it tastes better the next day so if you can, make this a day ahead of time.","93

36,Slow Cooker French Onion Soup,"This slow cooker French onion soup is ridiculously easy to make, mainly since it cooks in a slow cooker! After it's been simmering all day, you come home to an amazing aroma and a fabulous meal for a cold winter day. You do not have to caramelize the onions; you can melt the butter in your crockpot, stir in the onions to coat, add the remaining ingredients, and cook.

Heat butter in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle onions with sugar; reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are soft and caramelized, at least 30 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir sherry into onion mixture; scrape the bottom to dissolve the small bits of browned food. Transfer onions into a slow cooker and pour in beef broth. Season with sea salt; stir in thyme and bay leaf. Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours.
Preheat the oven broiler about 10 minutes before serving. Set an oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source.
Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet; broil until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
Lightly toss Gruyere, Emmental, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses in a bowl. Fill oven-safe soup crocks 3/4 full with onion soup and float a bread slice in each bowl. Top each with about 2 tablespoons cheese mixture.
Place filled bowls onto a baking sheet and broil until cheese topping is lightly browned and bubbling, about 2 minutes.

Tips
If you like, put all the soup components — soup, toasted bread, and cheese mixture — out on the table and let people make their soup! This seems to be the favored method when I host a craft night. People can make their own decisions about what they want in or on their soup!","250

Make sauce: Mix mayonnaise, horseradish, ketchup, paprika, cayenne, salt, oregano, and black pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined. Cover and store in the refrigerator until needed.
Make coating: Beat milk and egg together in a medium bowl until well combined. Mix flour, salt, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, oregano, thyme, and cumin together in a separate bowl. Set both bowls aside.
Prepare onion: Slice 1 inch off of the top and bottom of onion and remove the papery skin. Remove a 1-inch diameter core from middle of onion, leaving the very bottom of the root end intact. Use a large, sharp knife to slice down center of onion about 3/4 of the way down; turn onion 90 degrees and slice again. Keep slicing each section in half until you have 16 sections, being careful not to cut through bottom of onion.
Spread ""petals"" apart. (To help keep them separate, you could plunge onion into boiling water for 1 minute and then into cold water to stop the cooking.)
Dip onion into milk mixture and then coat well with seasoned flour mixture, separating the petals and sprinkling the flour mixture between them. Dip onion back into milk mixture, then coat with flour mixture again to ensure all pieces are well coated.
Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries.
Lower onion, cut-side up, into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain on a rack or on paper towels.
Open center of onion wide enough to fit the bowl of dipping sauce and serve.

Make sauce: Mix mayonnaise, horseradish, ketchup, paprika, cayenne, salt, oregano, and black pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined. Cover and store in the refrigerator until needed.
Make coating: Beat milk and egg together in a medium bowl until well combined. Mix flour, salt, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, oregano, thyme, and cumin together in a separate bowl. Set both bowls aside.
Prepare onion: Slice 1 inch off of the top and bottom of onion and remove the papery skin. Remove a 1-inch diameter core from middle of onion, leaving the very bottom of the root end intact. Use a large, sharp knife to slice down center of onion about 3/4 of the way down; turn onion 90 degrees and slice again. Keep slicing each section in half until you have 16 sections, being careful not to cut through bottom of onion.
Spread ""petals"" apart. (To help keep them separate, you could plunge onion into boiling water for 1 minute and then into cold water to stop the cooking.)
Dip onion into milk mixture and then coat well with seasoned flour mixture, separating the petals and sprinkling the flour mixture between them. Dip onion back into milk mixture, then coat with flour mixture again to ensure all pieces are well coated.
Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries.
Lower onion, cut-side up, into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain on a rack or on paper towels.
Open center of onion wide enough to fit the bowl of dipping sauce and serve.

90,Everything Onion Dip,"This onion dip is made with everything onions and is everything you'd ever want in an onion dip. Yellow, red, and green onions join savory shallots, flavorful chives, and the key ingredient, dried onion, which makes it taste like the French onion dip of your childhood. You can serve this dip with anything and everything, but if you have to pick, serve it with some sturdy, top-shelf potato chips for any big game or party. And if you're lucky enough to have leftovers, it makes the best baked potato topping!",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/283221/everything-onion-dip/,"1 medium yellow onion,2 tablespoons olive oil,1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste,½ cup minced shallots,½ cup diced red onions,½ teaspoon granulated garlic,1 tablespoon minced dried onion,¾ cup mayonnaise,2 cups sour cream,¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper,⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper,⅓ cup thinly sliced green onions, or more to taste,¼ cup thinly sliced fresh chives, or more to taste,","Directions
Cut both ends off the yellow onion and cut evenly into 2 halves. Remove and discard skin. Place onion halves on a cutting board with cut-sides down. Make vertical slices against the grain, then turn and slice across the cuts to chop. Chop again if you'd like smaller pieces. You should have about 2 cups chopped onion.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Transfer onion and salt into the hot oil. Cook until onions are deep brown in color, 7 to 8 minutes. Add shallots and red onions; stir and saute until they start to soften and sweeten, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in garlic and dried onion. Set aside to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, pepper, cayenne, and cooled onion mixture; mix until thoroughly combined. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 4 to 12 hours, or overnight.
Remove dip from the refrigerator and stir in green onions and chives. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer dip into a serving bowl and garnish with more green onions and chives to serve.

Chef's Notes:
Try to get the thickest, firmest sour cream you can buy. You can make this with all sour cream (instead of mayonnaise) but I think it's better with mayonnaise and sour cream.","107

93,Slow Cooker French Onion Soup,"This slow cooker French onion soup is ridiculously easy to make, mainly since it cooks in a slow cooker! After it's been simmering all day, you come home to an amazing aroma and a fabulous meal for a cold winter day. You do not have to caramelize the onions; you can melt the butter in your crockpot, stir in the onions to coat, add the remaining ingredients, and cook. However, caramelizing the onions makes for a much, much better soup!",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228859/slow-cooker-french-onion-soup/,"6 tablespoons butter,4 large yellow onions, sliced and separated into rings,1 tablespoon white sugar,2 cloves garlic, minced,½ cup cooking sherry,7 cups reduced-sodium beef broth,1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste,¼ teaspoon dried thyme,1 bay leaf,8 slices of French bread,½ cup shredded Gruyere cheese,⅓ cup shredded Emmental cheese,¼ cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese,2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese,","Directions
Heat butter in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle onions with sugar; reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are soft and caramelized, at least 30 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir sherry into onion mixture; scrape the bottom to dissolve the small bits of browned food. Transfer onions into a slow cooker and pour in beef broth. Season with sea salt; stir in thyme and bay leaf. Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours.

Lightly toss Gruyere, Emmental, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses in a bowl. Fill oven-safe soup crocks 3/4 full with onion soup and float a bread slice in each bowl. Top each with about 2 tablespoons cheese mixture.
Place filled bowls onto a baking sheet and broil until cheese topping is lightly browned and bubbling, about 2 minutes.

Tips
If you like, put all the soup components — soup, toasted bread, and cheese mixture — out on the table and let people make their soup! This seems to be the favored method when I host a craft night. People can make their own decisions about what they want in or on their soup!","250

94,Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce,This spicy onion ring sauce is great for serving in the center of a blooming onion to get your party going any day!,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17351/blooming-onion-and-dipping-sauce/,"½ cup mayonnaise,2 tablespoons cream-style horseradish sauce,1 tablespoon ketchup,⅓ teaspoon paprika,⅓ teaspoon cayenne pepper,¼ teaspoon salt,⅛ teaspoon dried oregano,1 pinch ground black pepper,1 cup milk,1 egg,1 cup all-purpose flour,1 ½ teaspoons salt,1 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper,1 teaspoon paprika,½ teaspoon ground black pepper,⅓ teaspoon dried oregano,⅛ teaspoon dried thyme,⅛ teaspoon ground cumin,1 large sweet onion,¾ cup vegetable oil for frying,","Directions
Make sauce: Mix mayonnaise, horseradish, ketchup, paprika, cayenne, salt, oregano, and black pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined. Cover and store in the refrigerator until needed.
Make coating: Beat milk and egg together in a medium bowl until well combined. Mix flour, salt, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, oregano, thyme, and cumin together in a separate bowl. Set both bowls aside.
Prepare onion: Slice 1 inch off of the top and bottom of onion and remove the papery skin. Remove a 1-inch diameter core from middle of onion, leaving the very bottom of the root end intact. Use a large, sharp knife to slice down center of onion about 3/4 of the way down; turn onion 90 degrees and slice again. Keep slicing each section in half until you have 16 sections, being careful not to cut through bottom of onion.
Spread ""petals"" apart. (To help keep them separate, you could plunge onion into boiling water for 1 minute and then into cold water to stop the cooking.)
Dip onion into milk mixture and then coat well with seasoned flour mixture, separating the petals and sprinkling the flour mixture between them. Dip onion back into milk mixture, then coat with flour mixture again to ensure all pieces are well coated.
Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries.
Lower onion, cut-side up, into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain on a rack or on paper towels.
Open center of onion wide enough to fit the bowl of dipping sauce and serve.
