0,Rustic Onion Tart,"Rustic onion tart with caramelized red onions, Gruyere cheese, and a butter crust.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/rustic_onion_tart/,,"Prepare the dough:
If you are making a crust from scratch, prepare the dough and let it chill in the refrigerator while you are cooking the onions.
To prepare the dough, whisk the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Cut the butter into the flour with your hands or with a pastry cutter, until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
Add the sour cream and use a fork to incorporate it into the dough. Gather the dough into a ball and shape it into a disk. Wrap it with plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour.
Prepare the onions:
Peel and slice the onlions lengthwise from stem to root. (See How to Slice an Onion)
Caramelize the onions:
Heat olive oil and butter in a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan on medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them.
Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent.
Elise Bauer

Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned.
Add balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.
Roll out the dough:
Preheat the oven to 450°F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand for 5 minutes before rolling it out.
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 13-inch diameter. Transfer the crust dough to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Layer the cheese and onions onto the dough:
Place all but a couple tablespoons of the cheese in the center of the dough. Spread to within 1 1/2 inches from the edges. Add the caramelized onions, layering them on top of the cheese. Sprinkle with thyme.

1,Pork Stir Fry With Green Onion,"This Pork Stir Fry is such an easy weeknight meal. Made with just lean pork, some green onions, and garlic, and ready in 25 minutes start to finish.

Pork chops tend to come in thicknesses either around 1/2 inch thick or an inch thick. If you are working with a thick boneless pork chop, start by slicing it into two thin layers, horizontally. If starting with pork loin, cut slices 1/2 inch thick.
Put the slices under some plastic wrap or wax paper and pound them thin with a rubber mallet, meat mallet or even an empty wine bottle. This will help tenderize the meat. The slices should be about 1/4 inch thick.
Cut the pork across the grain into thin strips, about 1 1/2 inches long.
Marinate the pork:
Put the soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch into a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the pork strips to the bowl with the marinade and toss to coat completely. Set aside for at least 10 minutes.
Stir fry pork on high heat:
Heat the peanut oil in a wok or large sauté pan on high heat. When the oil is hot (shimmering but not smoking) add the garlic slices and stir-fry until they begin to turn brown at the edges, about 30 seconds.
Add the pork strips and stir-fry until the pork changes color, about 90 seconds, stirring constantly.

Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Roast the vegetables until their edges are nicely caramelized, turning the radicchio and onion wedges over about halfway through the roasting.
The radicchio, onion, and squash will roast at different speeds. So periodically you'll have to remove the finished vegetables and let the others remain in the oven to finish roasting. As a guideline, roast the radicchio for about 25 minutes, turning halfway.
Roast the onions about 35 minutes, again, turning halfway. Roast the squash pieces for 45 minutes, but do not turn.
In all cases do not remove from the oven until you see browning on the edges.
Toast the pine nuts:
While the vegetables are roasting, toast the pine nuts. Heat a small pan on medium high heat. Add the pine nuts in a single layer. Cook until lightly toasted. Remove from heat to a bowl to keep the nuts from burning.
Chop roasted radicchio and onions:
Once all the vegetables are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the radicchio and onion into manageable pieces.
Toss with pine nuts, parsley, balsamic, black pepper:
Place the radicchio, onion, and butternut squash in a large serving bowl. Add the pine nuts and parsley. Add black pepper to taste. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar. Stir gently to combine, taking care not to squish the soft roasted squash.
To serve, sprinkle with some grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese.

6,How to Chop an Onion,"Here’s the best way to chop an onion safely and easily, plus a video with step-by-step instructions. No tears required!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_chop_an_onion/,"1 onion,","Slice 1/2 inch from stem end, barely slice root end:
Onions have two ends—a stem end, and a root end. Place the onion on a cutting board with the stem end pointing to the side.
Hold the onion firmly with one hand, and with the other hand, cut about 1/2-inch from the top of the stem end of the onion with a sharp chef's knife.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Then, turn the onion around and make a shallow cut (maybe 1/8-inch) off the root end, cutting off the stringy roots, but leaving the hard root core intact.
Cut onion in half, top to bottom:
Place the onion large-cut side down on the board (with the shallow root cut side on top). With the onion stabilized on the board, position the chef's knife directly over the root end of the onion and cut straight down to cut the onion in half.
Elise Bauer
Place the onion halves cut side down on the board to minimize exposure to the eye-hurting fumes coming from the cut sides of the onion.
Peel back the onion skin:
Peel back the onion skin of one of the onion halves. There is no need to pull it all the way off if it's still attached to the root end.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Make lengthwise cuts, angled toward center:
Place the onion half large-cut-side down on the cutting board. Make lengthwise cuts into the onion, from root end to stem end, with the knife tip almost all the way to the root end (but not cutting through the root end).
Cut at an angle as you go around the onion, with the blade aimed toward the center of the onion.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
The number of cuts depends on how big a chop or slice size you want, fewer cuts for thick slices or roughly chopped, more cuts for thin slices or finely chopped.
Make cross-wise cuts:
Once you are finished making angled lengthwise cuts, make cross-wise cuts. Hold the onion firmly with your fingers curled so that your knuckles press against the side of the knife as you cut the onion (This protects your fingertips from getting cut.).
As you make cuts from the end of the onion, scoot your hand back, using your knuckles as a guide for the knife.

7,Extra-Crunchy Onion Rings,"We’ve got the best crunchy, homemade onion rings made simple. Our batter uses cornmeal and buttermilk for an added tangy crunch.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/onion_rings/,"2 cups buttermilk, or 1 cup plain yogurt mixed with 1 cup milk,2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided,2 large yellow onions, peeled, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick ringed slices, rings separated (See How to Slice an Onion),1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided,1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour,1/3 cup cornmeal,3 cups frying oil, such as peanut oil, canola oil, or rice bran oil,","Coat the onion rings in seasoned buttermilk:
In a large bowl, stir together the buttermilk (or yogurt and milk) with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the black pepper.
Stir the onions into the buttermilk mixture and make sure every ring is completely coated in buttermilk. Let sit for 15 to 30 minutes.
Elise Bauer
Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl:
In a separate bowl (large enough to dredge the onion rings), whisk together the flour and cornmeal, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and set aside.
Heat the oil in thick-bottomed pot:
Add 2 to 3 cups of oil to a large (5- to 6-quart), thick-bottomed pot. (Make sure that the pot is absolutely dry on the inside before adding the oil or any residual water will splatter as the oil heats.) Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot by 3/4 to 1 inch.
Heat the oil to 375°F. Use a good candy thermometer or instant thermometer (such as a Thermapen) to measure the heat of the oil. You may need to tilt the pan in order to cover the thermometer's sensor completely and get an accurate reading.
Be very careful whenever handling hot oil. No running kids in the kitchen. No distractions. Do not answer the phone if it rings. Pay attention. Have the pan's lid close by.
Test the oil by dropping a small pinch of flour into the hot oil. If the flour sizzles the oil is ready. If it burns, remove the pot from the heat and let the oil cool down a little.
Elise Bauer
Dredge the buttermilk coated onion rings in the flour mixture (twice):
Remove onion rings one at a time out of the buttermilk mixture and dredge them in the flour mixture to coat.
Elise Bauer
If the coating seems a bit thin (it might) or if you want extra crunchy onion rings, dip the onion rings again in the buttermilk mixture and dredge them again in the flour. This double coating will make the onion rings extra crunchy.
Fry in the oil:
Use tongs to place the rings one by one into the hot oil. Fry for a minute on each side, until golden brown.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
When you add the onion rings to the pot, the oil temperature will naturally lower. Adjust the heat so that the temperature of the oil in the pan stays between 350°F and 390°F.
Keep warm in the oven:
Place the fried onion rings on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Keep the fried onion rings warm in a 200°F oven while you fry the rest of the rings.
Add more oil if needed between batches. Let the oil heat back up to 375°F before starting a new batch.
Serve immediately.
Note: It's best not to pour the leftover oil down the drain. Better to pour into an empty jar and discard with your trash.;","1771

Select the high sauté setting on your pressure cooker. If it’s an Instant Pot or similar model, the timer should default to a cooking time of 30 minutes. You will use every minute of this to sauté the onions.
Add the fat and caramelize the onions:
Add the butter or oil to the pressure cooker. Once the butter has melted or the oil shimmers, about 2 minutes, add the onions, sugar, and salt and stir with a wooden spoon, separating the onion layers and coating the slices with the fat.
Cover the pot with a tempered glass lid or other 9-inch pot lid and let the onions cook, without stirring, for 10 minutes.
Coco Morante

Coco Morante
Uncover the pot and continue cooking the onions:
Uncover the pot. At this point the onions should be softened, but not brown, and there should be some liquid at the bottom of the pot.
While wearing an oven mitt, hold the rim of the inner pot in place, and stir the onions vigorously. Be careful not to splash hot liquid on yourself.
Continue to stir the onions vigorously every 2 minutes, making sure to nudge loose any fond or brown bits from the bottom of the pot as it develops with your spoon. Do this until the sauté cooking program has ended after 30 minutes and the pot turns off automatically.
At this point, the onions should be caramelized and golden brown.
Coco Morante
Deglaze the pot and cook the soup under pressure:
While the pot is off but still hot and the onions are sizzling, add the sherry. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly scrape any remaining fond from the pot bottom.
Stir in the broth, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaf, and pepper. Secure the pressure cooker lid in its sealing position, then select the manual setting, and set the time for 5 minutes at high pressure.
(The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Release the pressure and prepare to serve:
When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes, then move the pressure release valve to ""venting"" to release any remaining steam.
At this point, the soup will stay hot on the “keep warm” setting for up to 10 hours, until you are ready to serve it.
When you are ready to serve the soup, discard the bay leaf. Taste the soup for seasoning, adding salt and/or pepper if needed.
Make the toasts and finish the soup:
Preheat the broiler on your oven and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place broiler-safe serving bowls on the baking sheet, then ladle the soup into the bowls, filling them to about 1/2-inch from the top.
Spread the baguette slices very sparingly with Dijon mustard (1/4 teaspoon per slice), then place the baguette slices on top of the bowls of soup.
Heap a pile of the Gruyere cheese onto each baguette slice. Grind one or two grinds of black pepper on top of each slice. Broil for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown.

Heat the olive oil and add the onion:
Use a wide, thick-bottomed sauté pan for maximum pan contact with the onions. Coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil, or a mixture of olive oil and butter, if using (about 1 teaspoon per onion).

Heat the pan on medium high heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the onion slices and stir to coat the onions with the oil. Spread the onions out evenly over the pan and let cook, stirring occasionally.
Depending on how strong your stovetop burner is you may need to reduce the heat to medium or medium low to prevent the onions from burning or drying out.
After 10 minutes, sprinkle some salt over the onions, and if you want, you can add some sugar to help with the caramelization process. (I add only about a teaspoon of sugar for 5 onions, you can add more.) One trick to keeping the onions from drying out as they cook is to add a little water to the pan.
Cambrea Bakes
Cambrea Bakes
Stir the onions every few minutes:
Let the onions cook for 30 minutes to 1 hour more, stirring every few minutes. As soon as the onions start sticking to the pan, let them stick a little and brown, but then stir them before they burn.
The trick is to leave them alone enough to brown (if you stir them too often, they won't brown), but not so long so that they burn. After the first 20 to 30 minutes you may want to lower the stove temperature a little, and add a little more oil, if you find the onions are verging on burning.
A metal spatula will help you scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan as the caramelization proceeds. As the onions cook down, you may find you need to scrape the pan every minute, instead of every few minutes.
Continue to cook and scrape, cook and scrape, until the onions are a rich, browned color. At the end of the cooking process you might want to add a little balsamic vinegar or wine to help deglaze the pan and bring some additional flavor to the onions.

If you are making your own crust (instead of using an already prepared frozen crust), roll out your dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9 x 1 1/2-inch round tart pan (or 9-inch pie dish), pressing dough into corners, extending the edges extra high to allow for shrinkage. Transfer to freezer to chill for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Line pastry with aluminum foil, pressing into the corners and edges, allowing extra foil on the sides (they'll be your handles when you remove the foil).
Fill at least 2/3 of the crust with baking weights—dried beans, rice, copper pennies, or ceramic or metal pie weights.
Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer
Bake with the weights:
Bake first for 15 minutes, remove from the oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove aluminum foil and weights.
Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer
Remove the weights and bake again:
Poke the bottom of pie pan with the tines of a fork and return to oven, and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden. (Fork holes allow any air to escape.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool while making the filling.

Caramelize the onions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan on medium heat. Add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them. Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned.
Add 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.

Trim the root end, keeping it intact:
Trim the roots but keep the root end intact. The root end will help hold the onion together as you make the other cuts.
Elise Bauer

Peel back the onion skin:
Peel back the onion skin and place the onion halves cut side down on the board. If you want, to help keep your cutting area tidy, peel off or cut off the onion skin from the root end.
Elise Bauer

Slice the onion, making angled cuts:
Cutting along the natural lines of the onion, make angled cuts into the onion, aimed at the center of the onion. Cut almost all the way, but not all the way, to the root.
It will be easier to handle the onion while cutting if the root end stays intact. Space your cuts depending on how thick you want your onion slices to be. More cuts for thinner slices, fewer cuts for thicker slices.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Make a ""V"" cut:
Cut a ""V"" in the root end to cut away the tough root end that is holding the onion slices together. Then break apart the onion to get the slices.
Elise Bauer

Method for Slicing an Onion Crosswise
Halve the onion root to tip:
Cut off the stem end by half an inch. Cut the root end by 1/8 of an inch, leaving the root core in place.
Place the onion stem cut side down on the cutting board, cut it in half through the root, and peel back the skins as in steps above for slicing an onion root to stem.
Place the onion cut side down:
Place the onion halves cut side down onto the cutting board. Do not remove the skin you peeled back, which will act as a handle as you slice closer to the end of the onion. Place the onion halves cut side down on the cutting board.
Guide the knife with your fingers:
Hold the onion firmly with one hand, with the fingers curled inward. With a sharp chef's knife in the other hand, place the side of the blade against the knuckles of your index and middle fingers.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Slice the onion halves:
Use this as a guide as you make slices through the onion. The curled fingers will protect your fingertips from the knife while cutting the onion.
When you get close to the root end, you can hold on to the peeled back skins as you make the final cuts in the onion.
Here's a tip for serving slice onions raw in a salad or sandwich: soak them in a little water with lemon juice or vinegar to remove the harsh bite of the onion!
Method for Slicing an Onion into Onion Rings
Cut the stem:
Cut off the stem end of the onion and peel back its outer peel.
Elise Bauer
Cut a sliver of onion:
With the peeled onion on its side, slice off a thin sliver from the side. Then place the onion on the cutting board with this thin sliver cut side down.
This will stabilize the onion's position so as you slice the onion rings, the onion will not roll.

Heat the olive oil and add the onion:
Use a wide, thick-bottomed sauté pan for maximum pan contact with the onions. Coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil, or a mixture of olive oil and butter, if using (about 1 teaspoon per onion).

Heat the pan on medium high heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the onion slices and stir to coat the onions with the oil. Spread the onions out evenly over the pan and let cook, stirring occasionally.
Depending on how strong your stovetop burner is you may need to reduce the heat to medium or medium low to prevent the onions from burning or drying out.
After 10 minutes, sprinkle some salt over the onions, and if you want, you can add some sugar to help with the caramelization process. (I add only about a teaspoon of sugar for 5 onions, you can add more.) One trick to keeping the onions from drying out as they cook is to add a little water to the pan.
Cambrea Bakes
Cambrea Bakes
Stir the onions every few minutes:
Let the onions cook for 30 minutes to 1 hour more, stirring every few minutes. As soon as the onions start sticking to the pan, let them stick a little and brown, but then stir them before they burn.
The trick is to leave them alone enough to brown (if you stir them too often, they won't brown), but not so long so that they burn. After the first 20 to 30 minutes you may want to lower the stove temperature a little, and add a little more oil, if you find the onions are verging on burning.
A metal spatula will help you scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan as the caramelization proceeds. As the onions cook down, you may find you need to scrape the pan every minute, instead of every few minutes.
Continue to cook and scrape, cook and scrape, until the onions are a rich, browned color. At the end of the cooking process you might want to add a little balsamic vinegar or wine to help deglaze the pan and bring some additional flavor to the onions.
Store refrigerated for several days in an air-tight container.

31,How to Chop an Onion,"Here’s the best way to chop an onion safely and easily, plus a video with step-by-step instructions. No tears required!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_chop_an_onion/,"1 onion,","Slice 1/2 inch from stem end, barely slice root end:
Onions have two ends—a stem end, and a root end. Place the onion on a cutting board with the stem end pointing to the side.
Hold the onion firmly with one hand, and with the other hand, cut about 1/2-inch from the top of the stem end of the onion with a sharp chef's knife.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Then, turn the onion around and make a shallow cut (maybe 1/8-inch) off the root end, cutting off the stringy roots, but leaving the hard root core intact.
Cut onion in half, top to bottom:
Place the onion large-cut side down on the board (with the shallow root cut side on top). With the onion stabilized on the board, position the chef's knife directly over the root end of the onion and cut straight down to cut the onion in half.
Elise Bauer
Place the onion halves cut side down on the board to minimize exposure to the eye-hurting fumes coming from the cut sides of the onion.
Peel back the onion skin:
Peel back the onion skin of one of the onion halves. There is no need to pull it all the way off if it's still attached to the root end.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
Make lengthwise cuts, angled toward center:
Place the onion half large-cut-side down on the cutting board. Make lengthwise cuts into the onion, from root end to stem end, with the knife tip almost all the way to the root end (but not cutting through the root end).
Cut at an angle as you go around the onion, with the blade aimed toward the center of the onion.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
The number of cuts depends on how big a chop or slice size you want, fewer cuts for thick slices or roughly chopped, more cuts for thin slices or finely chopped.
Make cross-wise cuts:
Once you are finished making angled lengthwise cuts, make cross-wise cuts. Hold the onion firmly with your fingers curled so that your knuckles press against the side of the knife as you cut the onion (This protects your fingertips from getting cut.).
As you make cuts from the end of the onion, scoot your hand back, using your knuckles as a guide for the knife.

Rich, intensely-flavored broth and caramelized onions, topped with crusty, cheese-covered bread is sure to warm anyone on a cold winter’s night. Make this delicious soup in half the time by using your Instant Pot!",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/instant_pot_french_onion_soup/,"1/4 cup unsalted butter or vegetable oil,2 1/2 to 3 pounds yellow or red onions, halved, peeled, and sliced 1/4-inch thick,1 tablespoon brown sugar,1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt,1/4 cup dry sherry or vermouth,4 cups low sodium beef broth,1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce,1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper,1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves,1 bay leaf,6 (1-inch thick) slices of a baguette,1 1/4 teaspoons Dijon mustard,1 cup grated Gruyere cheese,Freshly ground black pepper,","Set the cooking time:
Select the high sauté setting on your pressure cooker. If it’s an Instant Pot or similar model, the timer should default to a cooking time of 30 minutes. You will use every minute of this to sauté the onions.
Add the fat and caramelize the onions:
Add the butter or oil to the pressure cooker. Once the butter has melted or the oil shimmers, about 2 minutes, add the onions, sugar, and salt and stir with a wooden spoon, separating the onion layers and coating the slices with the fat.
Cover the pot with a tempered glass lid or other 9-inch pot lid and let the onions cook, without stirring, for 10 minutes.
Coco Morante

Uncover the pot and continue cooking the onions:
Uncover the pot. At this point the onions should be softened, but not brown, and there should be some liquid at the bottom of the pot.
While wearing an oven mitt, hold the rim of the inner pot in place, and stir the onions vigorously. Be careful not to splash hot liquid on yourself.
Continue to stir the onions vigorously every 2 minutes, making sure to nudge loose any fond or brown bits from the bottom of the pot as it develops with your spoon. Do this until the sauté cooking program has ended after 30 minutes and the pot turns off automatically.
At this point, the onions should be caramelized and golden brown.
Coco Morante
Deglaze the pot and cook the soup under pressure:
While the pot is off but still hot and the onions are sizzling, add the sherry. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly scrape any remaining fond from the pot bottom.
Stir in the broth, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaf, and pepper. Secure the pressure cooker lid in its sealing position, then select the manual setting, and set the time for 5 minutes at high pressure.
(The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Coco Morante
Release the pressure and prepare to serve:
When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes, then move the pressure release valve to ""venting"" to release any remaining steam.
At this point, the soup will stay hot on the “keep warm” setting for up to 10 hours, until you are ready to serve it.
When you are ready to serve the soup, discard the bay leaf. Taste the soup for seasoning, adding salt and/or pepper if needed.
Make the toasts and finish the soup:
Preheat the broiler on your oven and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place broiler-safe serving bowls on the baking sheet, then ladle the soup into the bowls, filling them to about 1/2-inch from the top.
Spread the baguette slices very sparingly with Dijon mustard (1/4 teaspoon per slice), then place the baguette slices on top of the bowls of soup.
Heap a pile of the Gruyere cheese onto each baguette slice. Grind one or two grinds of black pepper on top of each slice. Broil for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown.

33,Extra-Crunchy Onion Rings,"We’ve got the best crunchy, homemade onion rings made simple. Our batter uses cornmeal and buttermilk for an added tangy crunch.",https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/onion_rings/,"2 cups buttermilk, or 1 cup plain yogurt mixed with 1 cup milk,2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided,2 large yellow onions, peeled, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick ringed slices, rings separated (See How to Slice an Onion),1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided,1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour,1/3 cup cornmeal,3 cups frying oil, such as peanut oil, canola oil, or rice bran oil,","Coat the onion rings in seasoned buttermilk:
In a large bowl, stir together the buttermilk (or yogurt and milk) with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the black pepper.
Stir the onions into the buttermilk mixture and make sure every ring is completely coated in buttermilk. Let sit for 15 to 30 minutes.
Elise Bauer
Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl:
In a separate bowl (large enough to dredge the onion rings), whisk together the flour and cornmeal, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and set aside.
Heat the oil in thick-bottomed pot:
Add 2 to 3 cups of oil to a large (5- to 6-quart), thick-bottomed pot. (Make sure that the pot is absolutely dry on the inside before adding the oil or any residual water will splatter as the oil heats.) Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot by 3/4 to 1 inch.
Heat the oil to 375°F. Use a good candy thermometer or instant thermometer (such as a Thermapen) to measure the heat of the oil. You may need to tilt the pan in order to cover the thermometer's sensor completely and get an accurate reading.
Be very careful whenever handling hot oil. No running kids in the kitchen. No distractions. Do not answer the phone if it rings. Pay attention. Have the pan's lid close by.
Test the oil by dropping a small pinch of flour into the hot oil. If the flour sizzles the oil is ready. If it burns, remove the pot from the heat and let the oil cool down a little.
Elise Bauer
Dredge the buttermilk coated onion rings in the flour mixture (twice):
Remove onion rings one at a time out of the buttermilk mixture and dredge them in the flour mixture to coat.
Elise Bauer
If the coating seems a bit thin (it might) or if you want extra crunchy onion rings, dip the onion rings again in the buttermilk mixture and dredge them again in the flour. This double coating will make the onion rings extra crunchy.
Fry in the oil:
Use tongs to place the rings one by one into the hot oil. Fry for a minute on each side, until golden brown.
Elise Bauer
Elise Bauer
When you add the onion rings to the pot, the oil temperature will naturally lower. Adjust the heat so that the temperature of the oil in the pan stays between 350°F and 390°F.
Keep warm in the oven:
Place the fried onion rings on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Keep the fried onion rings warm in a 200°F oven while you fry the rest of the rings.
Add more oil if needed between batches. Let the oil heat back up to 375°F before starting a new batch.
Serve immediately.
Note: It's best not to pour the leftover oil down the drain. Better to pour into an empty jar and discard with your trash.;","1771
